This directory contains two Python programs that can be used to
convert SPARTA surface and grid data to ParaView .pvd format for
visualization with ParaView:

surf2paraview.py  
grid2paraview.py

Note that you must have ParaView installed on your system to use these
scripts.  Installation and usage instructions follow.

These tools were written by Tom Otahal (Sandia), who can
be contacted at tjotaha at sandia.gov.

-------------------------------

** Important **

The ParaView pvpython interpreter must be used to run these Python scripts.  
Using a standard Python interpreter will not work, since the scripts will
not have access to the required ParaView Python modules and libraries.

-------------------------------

** Important **

I. GETTING STARTED

Download and install ParaView at www.paraview.org.

Binary installers are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.
Locate the pvpython binary in your ParaView installation.  

  On Linux:

pvpython is in the bin/ directory of the extracted tar.gz file.

  On MacOS:

pvpython is in /Applications/paraview.app/Contents/bin/.

  On Windows:

pvpython is in C:\Program Files (x86)\ParaView 4.1.0\bin. 

-------------------------------

II. USING surf2paraview.py

The surf2paraview.py program converts 3D SPARTA surface triangulation
files and 2D SPARTA closed polygon files into ParaView .pvd format.
Additionally, the program can optionally read one or more SPARTA
surface dump files and associate the calculated results with the
surface geometry over time.

The program has two required arguments:

% pvpython surf2paraview.py data.mir mir_surf

The first argument is the file name of a SPARTA surf file containing a
3d triangulation of an objects surface, or a 2d enclosed polygon of
line segments.  The second argument is the name of the resulting
ParaView output .pvd file.  The above command line will produce a file
called mir_surf.pvd and a directory called mir_surf/.  The mir_surf/
directory contains a ParaView .vtu file with geometry information and
is referred to by the mir_surf.pvd file.  Start ParaView and open the
file mir_surf.pvd to visualize the surface.

The program has an optional argument to associate time result data
with the surface elements:

% pvpython surf2paraview.py data.mir mir_surf -r ../parent/mir/tmp_surf.*

The -r (or --result) option is followed by a list of file names with
full or relative paths to SPARTA surf dump files.  The files can be
over different time steps and from different processors at the same
time step. The script will organize the result files so that ParaView
can play a smooth animation over all time steps for the stored
variables in the file.  The example above uses a wild card character in
the file name to gather all of the tmp_surf.* files stored in the
directory.  Wild card characters can only be used in the file name part
of the path and can be given for multiple paths.

NOTE: SPARTA 2d enclosed polygons will be 2d outlines in ParaView.
This means that any grid cells inside of the polygon will be visible
in ParaView.  To obscure the inside of the enclosed polygon, select a
Delaunay 2D filter from the ParaView menu.

  Filters->Alphabetical->Delaunay 2D 

This will triangulate the interior of the polygon and obscure interior
grid cells from view.

-------------------------------

III. USING grid2paraview.py

The grid2paraview.py program converts a text file description of a 2D
or 3D SPARTA mesh into a ParaView .pvd file.  Additionally, the
program can optionally read one or more SPARTA grid dump files and
associate the calculated results with the grid cells over time.

The program has two required arguments:

% pvpython grid2paraview.py mir.txt mir_grid

The first argument is a text file containing a description of the
SPARTA grid.  The description uses commands found in the SPARTA input
deck.  These commands are dimension, create_box, and create_grid or
read_grid.  The file can also contain "slice" commands which will
define slice planes through the 3d grid and output 2d data for each
slice plane.  The file can also contain comment lines with start
with a "#" character.

The dimension and create_box command have exactly the same syntax as
corresponding SPARTA input script commands.  Both of these commands
must be used.

The grid itself can be defined by either a create_grid or read_grid
command, one of which must be used.  The create_grid command is
similar to the SPARTA input script command with the same name, but it
only allows for use of the "level" keyword.  The other keywords that
specify processor assignments for cells are not allowed.  The
read_grid command has the same syntax as the corresponding SPARTA
input script command, and reads a SPARTA parent grid file, which can
define a hierarchical grid with multiple levels of refinement.

One or more slice commands are optional.  Each defines a 2d plane
in the following manner

slice Nx Ny Nz Px Py Pz

where (Nx,Ny,Nz) is the plane normal (need not be normalized) and
(Px,Py,Pz) is a point on the plane.  Note that the plane can be at any
orientation.  ParaView will perform a good interpolation from the 3d
grid cells to the 2d plane.

Each command will output a *.pvd file with the plane normal encoded in
the *.pvd file-name.

As an example, the mir.txt file specified above could contain the
following grid description:

  dimension           3
  create_box          -15.0 30.0 -20.0 15.0 -20.0 20.0
  create_grid         100 100 100 level 2 * * * 2 2 2
  slice               1 0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0
  slice               0 1 0 0.0 0.0 0.0

The second argument for the grid2paraview command gives the name of
the resulting .pvd file.  The above command line will produce a file
called mir_grid.pvd and a directory called mir_grid/.  The mir_grid/
directory contains all the ParaView .vtu files used to describe the
grid cell geometry.  The mir_grid.pvd references the mir_grid/
directory.  Open mir_grid.pvd with ParaView to view the grid.

The program has an optional argument to associate time result data
with the grid cells:

% pvpython grid2paraview.py mir.txt mir_grid -r ../parent/mir/tmp_flow.*

The -r (or --result) option is followed by a list of file names with
full or relative paths to SPARTA grid dump files. This option operates
like the -r option in the surf2paraview.py program.

The grid description given in the *.txt file must match the data given
in the grid flow files. The grid flow files must also contain a column
that gives the SPARTA encoded integer id for the cell.

For large grids (greater than 100x100x100), the time to write out the
.pvd file and data directory can be lengthy.  For this reason, the
grid2paraview.py command has three additional options which can break
the grid into smaller chunks at the top-most level of the grid.  Each
chunk will be written out as a separate .vtu file in the named
sub directory the .pvd file refers to.

These additional options are:

-xc (or --xchunk, default 100)
-yc (or --ychunk, default 100)
-zc (or --zchunk, default 100)

The program will launch a separate thread of computation for each grid
chunk.  On workstations with many cores and sufficient memory, using
small chunks (of about 1 million cells each) can greatly speed up
output time. For 2d grids, the -zc option is ignored.

NOTE: On Windows platforms, the grid blocking will always be executed
serially.  This is due to how the multiprocessing module is
implemented on Windows, which prohibits multiple instances of pvpython
from starting independently.
