<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a model for surface chemistry reactions to perform when
particles collide with surface elements or the global boundaries of
the simulation box.  One or more models can be defined and assigned to
different surfaces or simulation box boundaries via the
<A HREF = "surf_modify.html">surf_modify</A> or <A HREF = "bound_modify.html">bound_modify</A>
commands.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_9">Section 6.9</A> for more
details of how SPARTA defines surfaces as collections of geometric
elements, triangles in 3d and line segments in 2d.  Also see the
<A HREF = "react.html">react</A> command for specification of a gas-phase chemistry
reaction model.
</P>
<P>The ID for a surface reaction model is used to identify it in other
commands.  Each surface reaction model ID must be unique.  The ID can
only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
</P>
<P>For the <I>adsorb</I> style, particles are allowed to adsorb on the surface. 
These adsorbed particles can undergo reactions with other adsorbed particles 
as well as the gas-phase particles that strike the surface. When a particle
adsorbs on the surface, it is deleted and the number of adsorbed particles 
of that particular species is incremented. When a particle desorbs from the 
surface, a new particle is created and the count is decremented. The exact 
location of the adsorbed particles is not stored and they are assumed to 
uniformly distributed throughout the surface element. 
</P>
<P>The surface reaction models for the <I>adsorb</I> style are described
below. There are two types of reactions in the <I>adsorb</I> style - 
gas-surface (GS) and pure-surface (PS). The GS reactions involve 
both gas-phase and adsorbed/bulk species as reactants. Hence GS 
reactions occur when gas particles collide with the surface. On 
the other hand, the PS reactions involve only adsorbed/bulk reactants
and do not include any gas-phase atoms or molecules. They are carried 
out at the end of every <I>nsync</I> timesteps based on the current value 
of surface coverage of the various adsorbed species. 
</P>
<P>For GS reactions, when a particle collides with a surface element or boundary.
the list of all reactions possible with that species as the reactant
is looped over.  A probability for each reaction is calculated, using
the formulas discussed below, and a random number is used to decide
which reaction (if any) takes place.  A check is made that the sum of
probabilities for all possible reactions is <= 1.0, which should
normally be the case if reasonable reaction coefficients are defined.
</P>
<P>For PS reactions, a time counter algorithm is used. Each reaction has a time counter 
<I>tau</I> that is increased by a value of <I>nsync*timestep</I> if all the reactants are 
available. The rate of each reaction <I>R</I> is computed based on the specified reaction 
rate constants as well as the surface coverage of the reactants. The product of the 
rate <I>R</I> and time counter <I>tau</I> is normalized to obtain the probability for each of 
reaction; and a random number is used to decide which reaction occurs. The chosen
reaction is perforemd and its time counter is modified as follows:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/time_counter.png">
</CENTER>
<P>Now the probabilities of each reaction are recomputed and a new reaction is chosen based on
these probabilties and performed; and this process is repeated till the 
probability of all the reactions reaches zero. A detailed description can be found in 
Swaminathan Gopalan <I>et al.</I> <A HREF = "#SG18">(SG18)</A>.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: A surface reaction model can not be specified for
surfaces whose surface collision style does not support reactions.
Currently this is only the <I>vanish</I> collision style.  See the
<A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide</A> doc page for details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For the <I>adsorb</I> style, one or two (for gs/ps option) file(s) is specified 
which contains a list of surface chemical reactions, with their associated 
parameters.  The reactions are read into SPARTA and stored in a list.  Each 
time a simulation is run via the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command, the list is scanned, 
and only active reactions are stored. In order for a reaction to be active, 
all the reactants and all the products must be currently defined as 
species-IDs; and also all the surface reactants and products must be present 
within the list of species that are allowed to adsorb on the surface.
This list of species is provided at the end of the surf_react adsorb command. 
Thus the file can contain more reactions than are used in a particular
simulation.  See the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command for how species
IDs are defined.  This style thus defines N reactions, where
N is the total number of reactions listed in the specified file(s).
</P>
<P>As explained below each reaction has a specified probability between
0.0 and 1.0.  That probability is used to choose which reaction (if
any) is performed.
</P>
<P>The format of the input surface reaction file is as follows.  Comments
or blank lines are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a
"#" character.  All other entries must come in 2 or more lines with
values separated by whitespace in the following format
</P>

scattering-model args 
</PRE>
<P>The first line is a text-based description of a single reaction. R1, R2, and 
R3 are the reactants; while P1, P2, and P3 are the products listed as a 
<A HREF = "species.html">species</A> IDs. The phase of the 
reactants and products are species in the brackets right next to the species ID. 
It can be one of the following
</P>
<PRE>(g) - gas phase = gas particle striking or scattering from the surface
(s) - surface phase = adsorbed particle present on the surface
(b) - bulk phase = material with which the surface is made of 
</PRE>
<P>For a GS reaction R1 must be a gas-phase reactant - the particle that collides 
with the surface/boundary. For a PS reaction R1 must be an adsorbed or bulk-phase species. 
</P>
<P>Individual reactants and products must be separated by whitespace
and a "+" sign. The left-hand and right-hand sides of the equation must be separated
by whitespace and "-->". 
The <I>type</I> of each reaction is a string of characters (upper or lower
case). The different types of GS and PS reactions are described below.

post collision.

<P>If there are gas-phase products, the user has an option of specifying the 
model by the particle scatters from the surface, which can be different 
from the surface collision model assigned to the surface element using the <A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide</A>
command. Any of the following surface collision models can be used: 
<I>specular</I>, <I>diffuse</I>, <I>cll</I>, <I>impulsive</I>, <I>td</I>. The scattering model style
and the corresponding arguments are specified in the next line after the 
reaction-style. If there are two gas-phase products, the scattering model 
for the second particle is defined in a new line. The arguments for the different 
surface scattering models is similar to the <A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide</A> 
command. If the user does not wish to specify a scattering model, <I>NULL</I> keyword
can be specified.

<P>All the surface reaction models calculate a global vector of values.
The values can be used by the <A HREF = "stats_style.html">stats_style</A> command

means they can be used by any command that uses a variable as input,

</P>
<P>The first element of the vector is the count of particles that
performed surface reactions for surface elements assigned to this
reaction model during the current timestep. The second element is the
cummulative count of particles that have performed reactions since the
beginning of the current run.  The next nlist elements are the count
of each individual reaction that occurred during the current timestep.
The final nlist elements are the cummulative count of each individual
