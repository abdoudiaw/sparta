<H3>surf_modify command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>surf_modify keyword args ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>one or more keyword/arg pairs may be listed 

<LI>keyword = <I>collide</I> 

<PRE>  <I>collide</I> args = surf-ID sc-ID
    surf-ID = ID of a surface
    sc-ID = ID of a surface collision model 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>surf_modify collide 1 2
surf_modify collide sphere bounce 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Set parameters for surface elements that have been read in by the
<A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command.  For each file of objects read by
a <A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command, a surface ID is assigned.  This
is the <I>surf-ID</I> argument described above as an argument of various
keywords.
</P>
<P>The <I>collide</I> keyword is used to assign a surface collision model to a
set of surface elements.  The set of surface elements is specified by
<I>surf-ID</I>.  The surface collision model is defined by the
<A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide</A> command.  Which collision model to
use is specified as <I>sc-ID</I>, which is the ID used in the
<A HREF = "surf_collide.html">surf_collide</A> command.
</P>
<P>The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with these
surface elements will be computed by the specified surface collision
model.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>All surface elements must be assigned to a surface collision model via
the <I>collide</I> keyword before a simlulation can be performed.
