<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a model for particle-surface collisions.  One or more models
can be defined and assigned to different surfaces or simulation box
boundaries via the <A HREF = "surf_modify.html">surf_modify</A> or
<A HREF = "bound_modify.html">bound_modify</A> commands.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_9">Section
4.9</A> for more details of how SPARTA defines
surfaces as collections of geometric elements, triangles in 3d and
line segments in 2d.
</P>
<P>The ID for a surface collision model is used to identify it in other
commands.  Each surface collision model ID must be unique.  The ID can
only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>specular</I> style computes a simple specular reflection model.  It
requires no arguments.  Specular reflection means that a particle
reflects off a surface element with its incident velocity vector
reversed with respect to the outward normal of the surface element.
The particle's speed is unchanged.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>diffuse</I> style computes a simple diffusive reflection model.
</P>
<P>The model has 2 parameters set by the <I>Tsurf</I> and <I>acc</I> arguments.
<I>Tsurf</I> is the temperature of the surface.  <I>Acc</I> is an accommodation
coefficient.
</P>
<P>Diffuse reflection emits the particle from the surface with no
dependence on its incident velocity.  A new velocity is assigned to
the particle, sampled from a Gaussian distribution consistent with the
surface temperature.  The new velocity will have thermal components in
the direction of the outward surface normal and the plane tangent to
the surface given by:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/diffuse_normal.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>The <I>Tsurf</I> value can be specified as an equal-style
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>.  If the value is a variable, it should be
specified as v_name, where name is the variable name.  In this case,
the variable will be evaluated each timestep, and its value used to
determine the current surface temperature.
</P>
<P>Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include <A HREF = "status_style.html">stats_style</A> command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.  Thus it is easy to specify a time-dependent temperature.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>vanish</I> style simply deletes any particle which hits the surface.
</P>
<P>This is useful if a surface is defined to be an inflow boundary on the
simulation domain, e.g. using the <A HREF = "fix_emit_surf.html">fix emit/surf</A>
command.  Using this surface collision model will also treat the
surface as an outflow boundary.  This is similar to using the <A HREF = "fix_emit_face.html">fix
emit/face</A> command on a simulation box face while
also setting the face to be an outflow boundary via the <A HREF = "boundary.html">boundary
o</A> command.
</P>
<P>Note that the <A HREF = "surf_react.html">surf_react global</A> command can also be
used to delete particles hitting a surface, by setting the <I>pdelete</I>
parameter to 1.0.  Using a surf_collide vanish command is simpler.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The keyword <I>translate</I> can only be applied to the <I>diffuse</I> style.
It models the surface as if it were translating with a constant
velocity, specified by the vector (Vx,Vy,Vz).  This velocity is added
to the final post-collisional velocity of each particle that collides
with the surface.
</P>
<P>The keyword <I>rotate</I> can only be applied to the <I>diffuse</I> style.  It
models the surface as if it were rotating with a constant angular
velocity, specified by the vector W = (Wx,Wy,Wz), around the specified
point P = (Px,Py,Pz).  Note that W and P define the rotation axis.
The magnitude of W defines the speed of rotation.  I.e. if the length
of W = 2*pi then the surface is rotating at one revolution per time
unit, where time units are defined by the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> command.
</P>
<P>When a particle collides with the surface at a point X = (x,y,z), the
collision point has a velocity given by V = (Vx,Vy,Vz) = W cross
(X-P).  This velocity is added to the final post-collisional velocity
of the particle.
</P>
<P>The <I>rotate</I> keyword can be used to treat a simulation box boundary as
a rotating wall, e.g. the end cap of an axisymmetric cylinder.  Or to
model a rotating object consisting of surface elements, e.g. a sphere.
In either case, the wall or surface elements themselves do not change
position due to rotation.  They are simply modeled as having a
tangential velocity, as if the entire object were rotating.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: For both the <I>translate</I> and <I>rotate</I> keywords the
added velocity can only be tangential to the surface, with no normal
component since the surface is not actually moving in the normal
direction.  SPARTA does not check that the specified translation or
rotation produces a tangential velocity.  However if does enforce the
condition by subtracting off any component of the added velocity that
is normal to the simulation box boundary or individual surface
element.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>All the surface collide models calculate a global vector of length 2.
The values can be used by the <A HREF = "stats_style.html">stats_style</A> command
and by <A HREF = "variable.html">variables</A> that define formulas.  The latter
means they can be used by any command that uses a variable as input,
e.g. "the <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix ave/time</A> command.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section
4.4</A> for an overview of SPARTA output
options.
</P>
<P>The first element of the vector is the count of particles that hit
surface elements assigned to this collision model during the current
timestep.  The second element is the cummulative count of particles
that have hit surface elements since the current run began.
