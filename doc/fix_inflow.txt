inflow = style name of this fix command :l
mix-ID = ID of mixture to use when creating particles :l
face1,face2,... = one or more of {all} or {xlo} or {xhi} or {ylo} or {yhi} or {zlo} or {zhi} :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {n} or {nevery} or {perspecies} :l
  {n} value = Np = number of particles to create
  {nevery} value = Nstep = insert every this many timesteps
  {perspecies} value = {yes} or {no} :pre

[Examples:]

fix in inflow air all
fix in inflow mymix xlo yhi n 1000 nevery 10 :pre

[Description:]

Insert particles into the simulation box continuously during a
simulation.  The particles are inserted on the specified faces of the
box using properties of the specified mixture.  If invoked every
timestep, this fix induces a continuous influx of particles thru the
face(s).

The properties of the inserted particles are from the mixture with ID
{mix-ID}.  This determines the number and species of added particles,
as well as their streaming velocity, thermal temperature, and internal
energy modes.  The details are explained below.

One or more faces of the simulation box can be specified via the
{face1}, {face2}, etc arguments.  The 6 possible faces can be
specified as {xlo}, {xhi}, {ylo}, {yhi}, {zlo}, or {zhi}.  Specifying
{all} is the same as specifying all 6 individual faces.

On each insertion timestep, each grid cell with one or more faces
touching an inflow boundary performs the following computations to
insert particles.  The insertion occus at the beginning of the SPARTA
timestep.

The molecular flux across a grid cell face per unit time is given by
equation 4.22 of "(Bird94)"_#Bird94.  The number of particles {M} to
insert on a particular grid cell face is based on this flux and
additional global, flow, and cell face properties:

global property: {fnum} ratio as specified by the "global"_global.html" command
flow properties: number density, streaming velocity, and thermal temperature
cell face properties: area of face and its orientation relative to the streaming velocity :ul

The flow properties are defined for the specified mixture via the
"mixture"_mixture.html command.

If {M} has a fractional value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles are
inserted, and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.  Each
particle is inserted at a random location on the grid cell face.  The
particle species is chosen randomly in accord with the {frac} settings
of the collection of species in the mixture, as set by the
"mixture"_mixture.html command.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The preceeding calculation is actually done using face
areas associated with {weighted} cell volumes.  Grid cells can be
weighted using the "global weight"_global.html command.

The velocity of the particle is set to the sum of the streaming
velocity and a thermal velocity sampled from the thermal temperature.
The internal energy modes of the particle are determined by the
thermal temperature and the {rotate} and {vibrate} options of the
"collide_modify"_collide_modify.html command.  Note that if the
"collide"_collide.html command has not been specified (free molecular
flow), then no rotational or vibrational energy will be assigned to
created particles.

If the final particle velocity is not directed "into" the grid cell,
then the velocity sampling procedure is repeated until it is.  This
insures that all inserted particles enter the simulation domain, as
desired.

The first timestep that inserted particles are advected, they move for
a random fraction of the timestep.  This insures a continuous flow
field of particles entering the simulation box.

The {n} keyword can alter how many particles are inserted, which can
be useful for debugging purposes.  If {Np} is set to 0, then the
number of inserted particles is a function of {fnum}, {nrho}, and
other mixture settings, as described above.  If {Np} is set to a value
> 0, then the {fnum} and {nrho} settings are ignored, and exactly {Np}
particles are inserted on each insertion timestep.  This is done by
dividing {Np} by the total number of grid cells that are adjacent to
the specified box faces and inserting an equal number of particles per
grid cell.

The {nevery} keyword determines how often particles are inserted.  If
{Nstep} > 1, this may give a non-continuous, clumpy distribution in
the inlet flow field.

The {perspecies} keyword determines how the species of each inserted
particle is randomly determined.  This has an effect on the
statistical properties of inserted particles.

If {perspecies} is set to {yes}, then a target insertion number {M} in
a grid cell is calculated for each species, which is a function of the
relative number fraction of the species, as set by the "mixture
nfrac"_mixture.html command.  If {M} has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles of that species will always be inserted,
and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.

If {perspecies} is set to {no}, then a single target insertion number
{M} in a grid cell is calculated for all the species.  Each time a
particle is inserted, a random number is used to choose the species of
the particle, based on the relative number fractions of all the
species in the mixture.  As before, if {M} has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will always be inserted, and a 13th
depending on the value of a random number.

Here is a simple example that illustrates the difference between the
two options.  Assume a mixture with 2 species, each with a relative
number fraction of 0.5.  Assume a particular grid cell inserts 10
particles from that mixture.  If {perspecies} is set to {yes}, then
exactly 5 particles of each species will be inserted on every timestep
insertions take place.  If {perspecies} is set to {no}, then exactly
10 particles will be inserted every time and on average the insertion
will be 5 particles of each of the two species.  But on one timestep
it might be 6 of the first and 4 of the second.  On another timestep
it might be 3 of the first and 7 of the second.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix computes a global vector of length 2 which can be accessed by
various output commands.  The first element of the vector is the total
number of particles inserted on the most recent insertion step.  The
second element is the cummulative total number inserted since the
beginning of the run.  The 2nd value is initialized to zero each time
a run is performed.

[Restrictions:]

Particles cannot be inserted on {z} faces of the simluation box for a
2d simulation.  Particles cannot be inserted on periodic faces of the
simulation box.

A {n} setting of {Np} > 0 can only be used with a {perspecies} setting
of {no}.

A warning will be issued if a specified inflow face has an inward
normal in a direction opposing the streaming velocity.  This is
because no particles will be inserted on that face.
