group command :h3

[Syntax:]

group ID which style args :pre

ID = user-defined name of the grid or surface group :ulb,l
which = {grid} or {surf} :l
style = {type} or {region} or {subtract} or {union} or {intersect} or {clear} :l
  {type} args = list of one or more surface types
  {region} args = region-ID rflag
    region-ID = ID of region which surface element must be in
    rflag = {any} or {all} or {center}
  {subtract} args = two or more group IDs
  {union} args = one or more group IDs
  {intersect} args = two or more group IDs
  {clear} = no args
:ule

[Examples:]

group sphere surf type 1 2
group patch surf region cutout
group boundary surf subtract all a2 a3
group boundary surf union lower upper
group boundary surf intersect upper leftside :pre

[Description:]

Identify a collection of surface elements as a surface group.  The
surface group ID can then be used in other commands such as "dump
surf"_dump.html, compute surf"_compute_surf.html, or
"surf_modify"_surf_modify.html to act on those surface elements
together.

If the group ID already exists, the specified surface elements
are added to the group.

A surface group with the ID {all} is predefined.  All surface elements
belong to this group.

The {type} style put all surface elements with the specified type into
the group.  See the "read_surf"_read_surf.html command for details of
how types are assigned to individual elements when they are read in
from a file.

The {region} style puts all surface elements in the region volume
associated with the {region-ID} into the group.  See the
"region"_region.html command for details of what kind of geometric
regions can be defined.  Note that the region side" option can be used
to define whether the inside or outside of the geometric region is
considered "in" the region.

The {rflag} setting determines how a surface element is judged to be
in the region or not.  For {rflag} = {any}, it is in the region if any
of its corner points (3 for triangle, 2 for line) is in the region.
For {rflag} = {all}, all its corner points must be in the region.  For
{rflag} = {center}, the center point of the line segment or median
point of the triangle must be in the region.

The {subtract} style takes a list of two or more existing group names
as arguments.  All surface elements that belong to the 1st group, but
not to any of the other groups are added to the specified group.

The {union} style takes a list of one or more existing group names as
arguments.  All surface elements that belong to any of the listed
groups are added to the specified group.

The {intersect} style takes a list of two or more existing group names
as arguments.  Surface elements that belong to every one of the listed
groups are added to the specified group.

The {clear} style un-assigns all surface elements that were assigned
to that group.  This is a way to empty a group before adding more
surface elements to it.

:line

[Restrictions:]

No more than 32 surface groups can be defined, including "all".

[Related commands:]

"dump"_dump.html, "region"_region.html, "compute
surf"_compute_surf.html

[Default:]

All surface elements belong to the "all" group.
