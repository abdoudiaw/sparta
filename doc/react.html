<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define chemical reactions to perform when particle-particle collisions
occur.
</P>
<P>The <I>none</I> style means that no chemistry will be performed, which is
the default.
</P>
<P>For other styles, a file is specified which contains a list of
chemical reactions, with their associated parameters.  The reactions
are read into SPARTA and stored in a list.  Each time a simulation is
run via the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command, the list is scanned.  Only
reactions for which all the reactants and all the products are
currently defined as species-IDs will be active for the simulation.
Thus the file can contain more reactions than are used in a particular
simulation.  See the <A HREF = "species.html">species</A> command for how species
IDs are defined.
</P>
<P>The reaction models for the various styles are described below.
</P>
<P>The format of the reaction file is the same for all three of the
currently defined styles, and is also described below.  The various
styles interpret and compute the specified reactions in different
ways.  The data directory in the SPARTA distribution contains reaction
files for these reaction models, all with the suffix ".tce".
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>tce</I> style is Bird's Total Collision Energy (TCE) model.  When
this style is specified, all computed reactions will use the TCE
model.
</P>
<P>Using kinetic theory, the TCE model allows for reaction probabilities
to be defined based on known, measured, reaction rates.  The model is
described in detail in <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>; see chapter 6. The required
input parameters for each reaction (discussed below) are values that
permit its effective Arrhenius rate to be calculated, namely
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/arrhenius.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where K(T) is the forward reaction rate, T is the temperature of the
participating molecules which is a function of their velocities and
internal energy states, k the Boltzmann constant, and A,b,Ea are input
parameters as discussed below.
</P>
<P>All 5 reactions coefficients read from the reaction file (described
below) are used to calculate terms in equation 6.10 of
<A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A> for the probability that a reaction takes place.
</P>
<P>The C2, C3, C4 values are the Arrhenius activation energy Ea,
prefactor A, and exponent b, used in the rate formula above.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>qk</I> style is Bird's Quantum-Kinetic model (QK).  When this style
is specified, all computed reactions will use the QK model.
</P>
<P>The QK model implemented is that of <A HREF = "#Bird09">(Bird09)</A> as validated
<A HREF = "#Gallis09">(Gallis09)</A> and modified <A HREF = "#Gallis10">(Gallis10)</A>.
</P>
<P>The QK model depends solely on properties of the colliding molecules
and unlike the TCE model makes no use of measured reaction rates or 
adjustable parameters. The macroscopic properties used in the QK model 
are the available collision energy, activation energies, and quantized
vibrational energy levels.
</P>
<P>According to the QK model dissociation reactions take place when the 
maximum obtainable vibrational energy after an inelastic energy exchange
is higher than the dissociation level <A HREF = "#Bird09">(Bird09)</A>. 
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/qk_dissociation.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>Exchange reactions take place when the vibrational energy after a trial 
energy exchange is above the activation energy of the exchange reaction
<A HREF = "#Gallis10">(Gallis10)</A>. 
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/qk_exchange.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>A new version of the QK model for exchange reactions has been proposed
by <A HREF = "#Bird11">(Bird11)</A>.  This will be implemented in future releases of
SPARTA.
</P>
<P>For the QK model, SPARTA reads the same 5 coefficients per reaction
from the reaction file (described below) as for the TCE model.  Three
of the coefficients (C1,C2,C5) are used to calculate terms in equation
6.10 of <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A> for the probability that a reaction takes
place.  The Arrhenius rate parameters C3 and C4 are ignored by the QK
model.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>tce/qk</I> style is a hybrid model which can be used to compute
reactions using both the TCE and QK models.  When this style is
specified, reactions from the input file that are flagged with an A =
Arrhenius style will be computed using the TCE model.  Reactions from
the input file that are flagged with a Q = Quantum style will be
computed using the QK model.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The format of the input reaction file is as follows.  Comments or
blank lines are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#"
character.  All other entries must come in 2-line pairs with values
separated by whitespace in the following format
</P>
<PRE>R1 + R2 + ... --> P1 + P2 + ...
type style C1 C2 ... 
</PRE>
<P>The first line is a text-based description of a single reaction.  R1,
R2, etc are one or more reactants, listed as <A HREF = "species.html">species</A>
IDs.  P1, P2, etc are one or more products, also listed as
<A HREF = "species.html">species</A> IDs.  The number of allowed reactants and
products depends on the reaction type, as discussed below.  Individual
reactants and products must be separated by whitespace and a "+" sign.
The left-hand and right-hand sides of the equation must be separated
by whitespace and "-->".
</P>
<P>The <I>type</I> of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower
case) with the following meaning.  The type determines how many
reactants and products can be specified in the first line.
</P>
<PRE>D = dissociation = 2 reactants and 3 products
E = exchange = 2 reactants and 2 products
I = ionization = 2 reactants and 2 or 3 products
R = recombination 
</PRE>
<P>A dissociation reaction means that R1 dissociates into P1 and P2 when
it collides with R2.  R2 is preserved in the collision, so P3 = R2 is
required.
</P>
<P>An exchange reaction is a collision between R1 and R2 that results in
new products P1 and P2.  There is no restriction on the species
involved in the reaction.
</P>
<P>An ionization reaction with 2 products is typically a collision
between R1 and R2 that results in a positively charged ion and an
election.  However, SPARTA does not check for this, so there is no
restriction on the species involved in the reaction.
</P>
<P>An ionization reaction with 3 products is typically a collision
between a neutral R1 and an electon R2 which ejects an electron from
the neutral species, resulting in P1 and P2.  R2 is preserved in the
collision, so P3 = R2 is required.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Ionization and recombination reactions have not yet
been implemented in SPARTA.
</P>
<P>The <I>style</I> of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower
case) with the following meaning:
</P>
<UL><LI>A = Arrhenius 
<LI>Q = Quantum 
</UL>
<P>The style determines how many reaction coefficients are listed as C1,
C2, etc, and how they are interpreted by SPARTA.
</P>
<P>For both the A = Arrhenius style and Q = Quantum style, there are 5
coefficients:
</P>
<UL><LI>C1 = number of internal degrees of freedom (as defined by the TCE model)
<LI>C2 = Arrhenius activation energy Ea
<LI>C3 = Arrhenius prefactor A
<LI>C4 = Arrhenius exponent b
<LI>C5 = overall reaction energy (positive for exothermic) 
</UL>
<P>The different reaction styles use these values in different ways, as
explained above.
