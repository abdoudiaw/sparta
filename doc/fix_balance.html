</P>
<P>This command dynamically adjusts the assignment of grid cells and
their particles to processors as a simulation runs, to attempt to
balance the computational cost (load) evenly across processors.  The
load balancing is "dynamic" in the sense that rebalancing is performed
periodically during the simulation. To perform "static" balancing,
before or between runs, see the <A HREF = "balance_grid.html">balance_grid</A>
command.
</P>
<P>This command is useful to use during simulations where the spatial
distribution of particles varies with time, leading to load imbalance.
</P>
<P>After grid cells have been assigned, they are migrated to new owning
processors, along with any particles they own or other per-cell
attributes stored by fixes.  The internal data structures within
SPARTA for grid cells and particles are re-initialized with the new
decomposition.
</P>
<P>The details of how child cells are assigned to processors by the
various options of this command are described below.  The cells
assigned to each processor will either be "clumped" or "dispersed".
</P>
<P>The <I>rcb</I> keyword will produce clumped assignments of child cells to
each processor.  This means each processor's cells will be
geometrically compact.  The <I>random</I> and <I>proc</I> keywords will produce
dispersed assignments of child cells to each processor.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section 5.8</A> of the
manual for an explanation of clumped and dispersed grid cell
assignments and their relative performance trade-offs.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Rebalancing is attempted by this command once every <I>Nfreq</I> timesteps,
but only if the current imbalance factor exceeds the specified
<I>thresh</I>.  This factor is defined as the maximum number of particles
owned by any processor, divided by the average number of particles per
processor.  Thus an imbalance factor of 1.0 is perfect balance.  For
10000 particles running on 10 processors, if the most heavily loaded
processor has 1200 particles, then the factor is 1.2, meaning there is
a 20% imbalance.  The <I>thresh</I> setting must be >= 1.0.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: This command attempts to minimize the imbalance
factor, as defined above.  But computational cost is not strictly
proportional to particle count, depending on the
<A HREF = "collide.html">collision</A> and <A HREF = "react.html">chemistry</A> models being used.
Also, changing the assignment of grid cells and particles to
processors may lead to additional communication overheads, e.g.  when
migrating particles between processors.  Thus you should benchmark the
run times of your simulation to judge how often balancing should be
performed, and how aggressively to set the <I>thresh</I> value.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>random</I> keyword means that each grid cell will be assigned
randomly to one of the processors.  In this case every processor will
typically not be assigned exactly the same number of grid cells.
</P>
<P>The <I>proc</I> keyword means that each processor will choose a random
processor to assign its first grid cell to.  It will then loop over
its grid cells and assign each to consecutive processors, wrapping
around the collection of processors if necessary.  In this case every
processor will typically not be assigned exactly the same number of
grid cells.
</P>
<P>The <I>rcb</I> keyword uses a recurvise coordinate bisectioning (RCB)
algorithm to assign spatially-compact clumps of grid cells to
processors.  Each grid cell has a "weight" in this algorithm so that
each processor is assigned an equal total weight of grid cells, as
nearly as possible.  If the <I>weight</I> argument is specified as <I>cell</I>,
then the weight for each grid cell is 1.0, so that each processor will
end up with an equal number of grid cells.  If the <I>weight</I> argument
is specified as <I>part</I>, than the weight for each grid cell is the
number of particles it currently owns, so that each processor will end
up with an equal number of particles.
</P>
<P>Here is an example of an RCB partitioning for 24 processors, of a 2d
hierarchical grid with 5 levels, refined around a tilted ellipsoidal
surface object (outlined in pink).  This is for a <I>weight cell</I>
setting, yielding an equal number of grid cells per processor.  Each
processor is assigned a different color of grid cells.  (Note that
less colors than processors were used, so the disjoint yellow cells
actually belong to three different processors).  This is an example of
a clumped distribution where each processor's assigned cells can be
compactly bounded by a rectangle.  Click for a larger version of the

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>

<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global scalar which is the imbalance factor after
the most recent rebalance and a global vector of length 2 with
additional information about the most recent rebalancing. The 2 values
in the vector are as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>1 = max # of particles per processor
<LI>2 = imbalance factor before the last rebalance was performed 
</UL>
<P>As explained above, the imbalance factor is the ratio of the maximum
number of particles on any processor to the average number of
particles per processor.
