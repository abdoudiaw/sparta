[Description:]

This command adjusts the assignment of grid cells and their particles
to processors, to attempt to balance the computational cost (load)
evenly across processors.  The load balancing is "static" in the sense
that this command performs the balancing once, before or between
simulations. The assignments will remain static during the
subsequent run.  To perform "dynamic" balancing, see the "fix
balance"_fix_balance.html command, which can adjust the assignemt of
grid cells to processors on-the-fly during a run.

After grid cells have been assigned, they are migrated to new owning
processors, along with any particles they own or other per-cell
attributes stored by fixes.  The internal data structures within
SPARTA for grid cells and particles are re-initialized with the new
decomposition.

This command can be used immediately after the grid is created, via
the "create_grid"_create_grid.html or "read_restart"_read_restart.html
commands.  In the former case balance_grid can be used to partition
the grid in a more desirable manner than the default creation options
allow for.  In the latter case, balance grid can be used to change the
somewhat random assignment of grid cells to processors that will be
made if the restart file is read by a different number of processors
than it was written by.

This command can also be used once particles have been created, or a
simulation has come to equilibrium with a spatially varying density
distribution of particles, so that the computational load is more
evenly balanced across processors.

The details of how child cells are assigned to processors by the
various options of this command are described below.  The cells
assigned to each processor will either be "clumped" or "dispersed".

The {clump} and {block} and {rcb} styles will produce clumped
assignments of child cells to each processor.  This means each
processor's cells will be geometrically compact.  The {stride} and
{random} and {proc} styles will produce dispersed assignments of
child cells to each processor.

IMPORTANT NOTE: See "Section 5.8"_Section_howto.html#howto_8 of the
manual for an explanation of clumped and dispersed grid cell
assignments and their relative performance trade-offs.

The {none} style will not change the assignment of grid cells to
processors.  However it will update the internal data structures
within SPARTA that store ghost cell information on each processor for
cells owned by other processors.  This is useful if the "global
gridcut"_global.html command was used after grid cells were already
defined.  That command erases ghost cell information stored by
processors, which then needs to be re-generated before a simulation is
run.  Using the balance_grid none command will re-generate the ghost
cell information.

The {stride}, {clump}, and {block} styles can only be used if the
grid is "uniform".  The grid in SPARTA is hierarchical with one or
more levels, as defined by the "create_grid"_create_grid.html or
"read_grid"_read_grid.html commlands.  If the parent cell of every
grid cell is at the same level of the hierarchy, then for puposed os
this command the grid is uniform, meaning the collection of grid cells
effectively form a uniform fine grid overlaying the entire simulation
domain.

The meaning of the {stride}, {clump}, and {block} styles is exactly
the same as when they are used as keywords with the
"create_grid"_create_grid.html command.  See its doc page for details.

The {random} style means that each grid cell will be assigned
randomly to one of the processors.  Note that in this case every
processor will typically not be assigned the exact same number of
cells.

The {proc} style means that each processor will choose a random
processor to assign its first grid cell to.  It will then loop over
its grid cells and assign each to consecutive processors, wrapping
around the enumeration of processors if necessary.  Note that in this
case every processor will typically not be assigned exactly the same
number of cells.

The {rcb} style uses a recursive coordinate bisectioning (RCB)
algorithm to assign spatially-compact clumps of grid cells to
processors.  Each grid cell has a "weight" in this algorithm so that
each processor is assigned an equal total weight of grid cells, as
nearly as possible.  If the {weight} argument is specified as {cell},
then the weight for each grid cell is 1.0, so that each processor will
end up with an equal number of grid cells.  If the {weight} argument
is specified as {part}, than the weight for each grid cell is the
number of particles it currently owns, so that each processor will end
up with an equal number of particles.

Here is an example of an RCB partitioning for 24 processors, of a 2d
hierarchical grid with 5 levels, refined around a tilted ellipsoidal
surface object (outlined in pink).  This is for a {weight cell}
setting, yielding an equal number of grid cells per processor.  Each
processor is assigned a different color of grid cells.  (Note that
less colors than processors were used, so the disjoint yellow cells
actually belong to three different processors).  This is an example of
a clumped distribution where each processor's assigned cells can be
compactly bounded by a rectangle.  Click for a larger version of the

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used after the grid has been created by the
"create_grid"_create_grid.html, "read_grid"_read_grid, or
"read_restart"_read_restart.html commands.

This command also initializes various options in SPARTA before
performing the balancing.  This is so that grid cells are ready to
migrate to new processors.  Thus if an error is flagged, e.g. that a
simulation box boundary condition is not yet assigned, that operation
needs to be performed in the input script before balancing can be
performed.
