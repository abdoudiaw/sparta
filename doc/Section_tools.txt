7. Additional tools :h3

SPARTA is designed to be a computational kernel for performing DSMC
computations.  Additional pre- and post-processing steps are often
necessary to setup and analyze a simulation.  A few additional tools
are provided with the SPARTA distribution in the tools directory and
are described briefly below.

Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
"Pizza.py"_pizza which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for SPARTA simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in "Python"_python and is available for download from "the
Pizza.py WWW site"_pizza.

:link(pizza,http://pizza.sandia.gov)
:link(python,http://www.python.org)

Some of the Pizza.py tools relevant to SPARTA are as follows:

dump - read, write, manipulate particle dump files
gl - 3d interactive visualization via OpenGL of dump or surface files
sdata - read, write, manipulate surface files
slog - read log files and extract columns of data
vcr - VCR-style GUI for 3d interactive OpenGL visualization of dump or surface files :ul

The sdata and slog tools are included in the SPARTA distribution, as
discussed below, in the "pizza"_#pizzatools section, so that they
can be used by other provided Python scripts.

This is the list of tools included in the tools directory of the
SPARTA distribution.  Each is described below.

"dump2cfg"_#dump2cfg - convert a particle dump file to CFG format
"dump2xyz"_#dump2xyz - convert a particle dump file to XYZ format
"log2txt"_#log2txt - extract columns of info from a log file
"logplot"_#logplot - plot columns of info from a log file via GnuPlot
"pizza"_#pizzatools - Pizza.py tools used by other tools :ul

dump2cfg tool :h4,link(dump2cfg)

This is a Python script that converts a SPARTA particle dump file into
extended CFG format so that it can be visualized by the
"AtomEye"_http://mt.seas.upenn.edu/Archive/Graphics/A visualization
program.  AtomEye is a very fast particle visualizer, capable of
interactive visualizations of millions of particles on a desktop
machine.  It is commonly used in the materials modeling community.

See the header of the script for the syntax used to run it.

This script uses one or more of the "Pizza.py" tools provided in the
tools/pizza directory.  See the tools/README file for info on how to
set an environment variable so that the Pizza.py tool files can be
found by Python, as well as instructions on various ways to run a
Python script.

:line

dump2xyz tool :h4,link(dump2xyz)

This is a Python script that converts a SPARTA particle dump file into
XYZ format so that it can be visualized by various visualization
packages that read XYZ formatted files.  An example is
"VMD"_http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd package, commonly used in
the molecular dynamics modeling community.

See the header of the script for the syntax used to run it.

This script uses one or more of the "Pizza.py" tools provided in the
tools/pizza directory.  See the tools/README file for info on how to
set an environment variable so that the Pizza.py tool files can be
found by Python, as well as instructions on various ways to run a
Python script.

:line

log2txt tool :h4,link(log2txt)

This is a Python script that reads a SPARTA log file, extracts
selected columns of statistical output, and writes them to a text
file.  It knows how to concatenate log file info across multiple
successive runs.  The columnar output can then be read by various
plotting packages.

See the header of the script for the syntax used to run it.

This script uses one or more of the "Pizza.py" tools provided in the
tools/pizza directory.  See the tools/README file for info on how to
set an environment variable so that the Pizza.py tool files can be
found by Python, as well as instructions on various ways to run a
Python script.

:line

logplot tool :h4,link(logplot)

This is a Python script that reads a SPARTA log file, extracts the
selected columns of statistical output, and plots them via the GnuPlot
program.  It knows how to concatenate log file info across multiple
successive runs.

See the header of the script for the syntax used to run it.  You must
have GnuPlot installed on your system to use this script.  If you can
type "gnuplot" from the command line to start GnuPlot, it should work.
If not (e.g. because you need a path name), then edit these 2 lines as
needed in pizza/gnu.py:

except: PIZZA_GNUPLOT = "gnuplot"
except: PIZZA_GNUTERM = "x11"

For example, the first could become "/home/smith/bin/gnuplot".  The
second should only need changing if GnuPlot requires a different
setting to plot to your screen.

This script uses one or more of the "Pizza.py" tools provided in the
tools/pizza directory.  See the tools/README file for info on how to
set an environment variable so that the Pizza.py tool files can be
found by Python, as well as instructions on various ways to run a
Python script.

:line

pizza tool :h4,link(pizzatools)

The pizza sub-directory contains several of the tools available
in the "Pizza.py"_pizza toolkit.  This is so that other
Python scripts in the tools directory can use them directly.

See the tools/README file for info on how to set an environment
variable so that the Python scripts can find the Pizza.py tool files.
