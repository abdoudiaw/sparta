7. Additional tools :h3

SPARTA is designed to be a computational kernel for performing DSMC
computations.  Additional pre- and post-processing steps are often
necessary to setup and analyze a simulation.  A few additional tools
are provided with the SPARTA distribution in the tools directory and
are described briefly below.

TODO: be specific about what Pizza.py tools can work with SPARTA data 

Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
"Pizza.py"_pizza which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for SPARTA simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in "Python"_python and is available for download from "the
Pizza.py WWW site"_pizza.

TODO: any other tools

"binary2txt"_#binary :ul

binary2txt tool :h4,link(binary)

TODO: need to create this tool?  different options for particle/grid/surf

The file binary2txt.cpp converts one or more binary SPARTA dump files
into ASCII text files.  The syntax for running the tool is

binary2txt file1 file2 ... :pre

which creates file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.  This tool should be compiled
on a platform that can read the binary files created by a SPARTA run,
since binary files are not always compatible across all platforms.
