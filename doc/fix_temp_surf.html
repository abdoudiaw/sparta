<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Compute a surface element temperature once every Nevery steps.  This
command takes a compute or fix ID which should compute the flux of
total energy onto each surface elements, e.g. <I>etot</I> from the <A HREF = "compute_surf.html">compute
surf</A> command.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>group-ID</I> must be the name of a surface element group,
as defined by the <A HREF = "group.html">group surf</A> command, which contains a
set of surf elements.
</P>
<P>The specfied <I>Nevery</I> determines how often the surface temperatures
are re-computed.
</P>
<P>The <I>source</I> can be specified as a per surface element quantity
calculated by a compute, such as the <A HREF = "compute_surf.html">compute surf</A>
command.  It can also be specified a per surface element quantity
calculated by a fix that perform time-averaging, such as <A HREF = "fix_ave_surf.html">fix
ave/surf</A>.  That fix can time average per-surf
quantities from per-surf computes.
</P>
<P>The temperature of the surface element is calculated from the
Stefan-Boltzmann law for a gray-body, which states that 
</P>
<PRE>q_wall = sigma * emisurf * Tsurf^4 
</PRE>
<P>where q_wall is the heat flux to the surface, sigma is the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant, <I>emisurf</I> is the surface emissivity, and
<I>Tsurf</I> is the resulting surface temperature.
</P>
<P>The specified emissivity <I>emisurf</I> is a unitless coefficient from 0.0
to 1.0, which determines the emissivity of the surface.  An emissivity
coefficient of 1.0 means the surface is a black-body that radiates all
the energy it receives.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>Tsurf</I> is the initial temperature of each surface
element.  The value for each surface is reset every <I>Nevery</I> timesteps
by the formula above.

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Currently this fix can only be used in simulations that define
explicit non-distributed surfaces.  Distributed and implicit surface
support will be added at a later time.
