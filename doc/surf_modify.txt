surf_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_modify keyword args ... :pre

one or more keyword/arg pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keyword = {collide} :l
  {collide} args = surf-ID sc-ID
    surf-ID = ID of a surface
    sc-ID = ID of a surface collision model :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_modify collide 1 2
surf_modify collide sphere bounce :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters for surface elements that have been read in by the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command.  For each file of objects read by
a "read_surf"_read_surf.html command, a surface ID is assigned.  This
is the {surf-ID} argument described above as an argument of various
keywords.

The {collide} keyword is used to assign a surface collision model to a
set of surface elements.  The set of surface elements is specified by
{surf-ID}.  The surface collision model is defined by the
"surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command.  Which collision model to
use is specified as {sc-ID}, which is the ID used in the
"surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with these
surface elements will be computed by the specified surface collision
model.

[Restrictions:]

All surface elements must be assigned to a surface collision model via
the {collide} keyword before a simlulation can be performed.
