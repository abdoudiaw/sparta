surf_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_modify keyword args ... :pre

one or more keyword/arg pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keyword = {collide} or (react) :l
  {collide} args = surf-ID sc-ID
    surf-ID = ID of a surface
    sc-ID = ID of a surface collision model
  {react} args = surf-ID sr-ID
    surf-ID = ID of a surface
    sr-ID = ID of a surface reaction model or none :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_modify collide 1 2
surf_modify collide sphere bounce react sphere absorb :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters for surface elements that have been read in by the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command.  For each file of objects read by
a "read_surf"_read_surf.html command, a surface ID is assigned.  This
is the {surf-ID} argument described above as an argument for various
keywords.

The {collide} keyword is used to assign a surface collision model to a
set of surface elements.  The set of surface elements is specified by
{surf-ID}.  The surface collision model is defined by the
"surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command.  Which collision model to
use is specified as {sc-ID}, which is the ID used in the
"surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with these
surface elements will be computed by the specified surface collision
model.

The {react} keyword is used to assign a surface reaction model to a
set of surface elements.  The set of surface elements is specified by
{surf-ID}.  The surface reaction model is defined by the
"surf_react"_surf_react.html command.  Which reaction model to use is
specified as {sr-ID}, which is the ID used in the
"surf_react"_surf_react.html command.  If an sr-ID of {none} is used
then surface reactions are turned off.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with these
surface elements will induce reactions which are computed by the
specified surface reaction model.

[Restrictions:]

All surface elements must be assigned to a surface collision model via
the {collide} keyword before a simlulation can be performed.  
Using a surface reaction model is optional.

[Related commands:]

"read_surf"_read_surf.html, "bound_modify"_bound_modify.html

[Default:]

The default for surface reactions is none.
