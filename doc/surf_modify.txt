surf_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_modify keyword args ... :pre

one or more keyword/arg pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keyword = {collide} :l
  {collide} args = surf-ID sc-ID
    surf-ID = ID of a surface
    sc-ID = ID of a surface collision model :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_modify collide 1 2
surf_modify collide sphere bounce :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters for one of the boundaries of the global simulation box.
Any of the 6 faces can be selected via the {wall} setting. 

The {surf} keyword can only be used when the boundary is of type "s",
for surface, as set by the "boundary"_boundary.html command.  This
keyword assigns a surface collision model to the boundary, as defined
by the "surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command.  The ID of the
surface collision model is specified as {sc-ID}, which is the ID used
in the "surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with this
boundary will be computed by the specified surface collision model.

[Restrictions:]

For 2d simulations, the {zlo} and {zhi} boundaries cannot be modified
by this command, since they are always periodic.

[Default:] none
