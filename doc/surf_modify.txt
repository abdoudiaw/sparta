surf_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_modify group-ID keyword args ... :pre
group-ID = ID of the surface group to operate on :l
one or more keyword/arg pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keyword = {collide} or (react) :l
  {collide} args = sc-ID
    sc-ID = ID of a surface collision model
  {react} args = sr-ID
    sr-ID = ID of a surface reaction model or none :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_modify sphere collide 1 2
surf_modify all collide sphere bounce react sphere absorb :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters for a group of surface elements in the specified
group-ID.  Surface elements are read in by the
"read_surf"_read_surf.html command.  They can be assigned to groups by
that command or via the "group"_group.html command.

The {collide} keyword is used to assign a surface collision model.
Surface collision models are defined by the
"surf_collide"_surf_collide.html command, which assigns each a surface
collision ID, specified here as {sc-ID}.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with surface
elements in group-ID will be computed by the specified surface
collision model.

The {react} keyword is used to assign a surface reaction model.
Surface reaction models are defined by the"surf_react"_surf_react.html
command, which assigns each a surface reaction ID, specified here as
{sr-ID}.

The effect of this keyword is that particle collisions with surface
elements in group-ID will induce reactions which are computed by the
specified surface reaction model.

Note that if the same surface element is assigned to multiple groups,
using this command multiple times may override the effect of a
previous command that assigned a surface element to a different
collision or reaction model.

[Restrictions:]

All surface elements must be assigned to a surface collision model via
the {collide} keyword before a simlulation can be performed.  Using a
surface reaction model is optional.

[Related commands:]

"read_surf"_read_surf.html, "bound_modify"_bound_modify.html

[Default:]

The default for surface reactions is none.
