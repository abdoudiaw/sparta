<P>These commands will dump 10 time averaged energy flux densities for

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates components of the energy flux
density vector for each grid cell.  This is also called the heat flux
density vector, and is based on the thermal velocity of the particles
in each grid cell.  The values are tallied separately for each group
of species in the specified mixture, as described in the Output
section below.  See the mixture command for how a set of species can
be partitioned into groups.
</P>
<P>The values listed above rely on first computing and subtracting the
center-of-mass (COM) velocity for all particles in the group and grid
cell from each particle to yield a thermal velocity.  This thermal
velocity is used to compute the components of the energy flux density
vector, as described below.  This is in contrast to some of the values
tallied by the <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute grid temp</A> command which
simply uses the full velocity of each particle to compute a momentum
or kinetic energy density.  For non-streaming simulations, the two
results should be similar, but for streaming flows, they will be
different.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>The values over many sampling timesteps can be averaged by the <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A> command.  It does its averaging as if the
particles in the cell at each sampling timestep were combined together
into one large set of particles to compute the formulas below.  
</P>
<P>Note that the center-of-mass (COM) velocity that is subtracted from
each particle to yield a thermal velocity for each particle, as
described below, is also computed over one large set of particles
(across all timesteps), in contrast to using a COM velocity computed
only for particles in the current timestep, which is what the <A HREF = "compute_sonine_grid.html">compute
sonine/grid</A> command does.
</P>
<P>Note that this is a different form of averaging than taking the values
produced by the formulas below for a single timestep, summing those
values over the sampling timesteps, and then dividing by the number of
sampling steps.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Calculation of the energy flux density is done by first calcuating the
center-of-mass (COM) velocity of particles for each group.  grid cell.
This is done as follows:
</P>
<PRE>COMx = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i) / Sum_i (mass_i)
COMy = Sum_i (mass_i Vy_i) / Sum_i (mass_i)
COMz = Sum_i (mass_i Vz_i) / Sum_i (mass_i)
Cx = Vx - COMx
Cy = Vy - COMy
Cz = Vz - COMz
Csq = Cx*Cx + Cy*Cy + Cz*Cz 
</PRE>
<P>The COM velocity is (COMx,COMy,COMz).  The thermal velocity of each
particle is (Cx,Cy,Cz), i.e. its velocity minus the COM velocity of
particles in its group and cell.
</P>
<P>The <I>heatx</I>, <I>heaty</I>, <I>heatz</I> values compute the components of the
energy flux density vector due to particles in the group as follows:
</P>
<P>heatx = 0.5 * fnum/volume Sum_i (mass_i Cx Csq)
heaty = 0.5 * fnum/volume Sum_i (mass_i Cy Csq)
heatz = 0.5 * fnum/volume Sum_i (mass_i Cz Csq)
</P>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-grid array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if
<I>momxx</I> and <I>momxy</I> values were specified as keywords, then the first
two columns would be <I>momxx</I> and <I>momxy</I> for the first group, the 3rd
and 4th columns would be <I>momxx</I> and <I>momxy</I> for the second group, etc.
</P>
<P>This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section 4.8</A> of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
Note that cells inside closed surfaces contain no particles.  These
could be unsplit or cut cells (if they have zero flow volume).  Both
of these kinds of cells will compute a zero result for all their
values.  Likewise, split cells store no particles and will produce a
zero result.  This is because their sub-cells actually contain the
particles that are geometrically inside the split cell.
</P>
<P>The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section 4.4</A>
for an overview of SPARTA output options.
</P>
<P>The per-grid array values will be in the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A> of
energy flux density = energy-velocity/volume units.
