<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Emit particles from one or more faces of the simulation box,
continuously during a simulation.  If invoked every timestep, this fix
creates a continuous influx of particles thru the face(s).
</P>
<P>The properties of the added particles are determined by the mixture
with ID <I>mix-ID</I>.  This determines the number and species of added
particles, as well as their streaming velocity, thermal temperature,
and internal energy modes.  The details are explained below.
</P>
<P>One or more faces of the simulation box can be specified via the
<I>face1</I>, <I>face2</I>, etc arguments.  The 6 possible faces can be
specified as <I>xlo</I>, <I>xhi</I>, <I>ylo</I>, <I>yhi</I>, <I>zlo</I>, or <I>zhi</I>.  Specifying
<I>all</I> is the same as specifying all 6 individual faces.
</P>
<P>On each insertion timestep, each grid cell with one or more of its
faces touching a specified boundary <I>face</I> performs the following
computations to add particles.  The particles are added at the
beginning of the SPARTA timestep.
</P>
<P>The molecular flux across a grid cell face per unit time is given by
equation 4.22 of <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>.  The number of particles <I>M</I> to
insert on a particular grid cell face is based on this flux and
additional global, flow, and cell face properties:
</P>
<UL><LI>global property: <I>fnum</I> ratio as specified by the <A HREF = "global.html"">global</A> command
<LI>flow properties: number density, streaming velocity, and thermal temperature
<LI>cell face properties: area of face and its orientation relative to the streaming velocity 
</UL>
<P>The flow properties are defined for the specified mixture via the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.
</P>
<P>If <I>M</I> has a fractional value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles are added,
and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.  Each particle
is added at a random location on the grid cell face.  The particle
species is chosen randomly in accord with the <I>frac</I> settings of the
collection of species in the mixture, as set by the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The preceeding calculation is actually done using face
areas associated with <I>weighted</I> cell volumes.  Grid cells can be
weighted using the <A HREF = "global.html">global weight</A> command.
</P>
<P>The velocity of the particle is set to the sum of the streaming
velocity and a thermal velocity sampled from the thermal temperature.
The internal energy modes of the particle are determined by the
thermal temperature and the <I>rotate</I> and <I>vibrate</I> options of the
<A HREF = "collide_modify.html">collide_modify</A> command.  Note that if the
<A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command has not been specified (free molecular
flow), then no rotational or vibrational energy will be assigned to
created particles.
</P>
<P>If the final particle velocity is not directed "into" the grid cell,
then the velocity sampling procedure is repeated until it is.  This
insures that all added particles enter the simulation domain, as
desired.
</P>
<P>The first timestep that added particles are advected, they move for a
random fraction of the timestep.  This insures a continuous flow field
of particles entering the simulation box.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>n</I> keyword can alter how many particles are added, which can be
useful for debugging purposes.  If <I>Np</I> is set to 0, then the number
of added particles is a function of <I>fnum</I>, <I>nrho</I>, and other mixture
settings, as described above.  If <I>Np</I> is set to a value > 0, then the
<I>fnum</I> and <I>nrho</I> settings are ignored, and exactly <I>Np</I> particles are
added on each insertion timestep.  This is done by dividing <I>Np</I> by
the total number of grid cells that are adjacent to the specified box
faces and adding an equal number of particles per grid cell.
</P>
<P>The <I>nevery</I> keyword determines how often particles are added.  If
<I>Nstep</I> > 1, this may give a non-continuous, clumpy distribution in
the inlet flow field.
</P>
<P>The <I>perspecies</I> keyword determines how the species of each added
particle is randomly determined.  This has an effect on the
statistical properties of added particles.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then a target insertion number <I>M</I> in
a grid cell is calculated for each species, which is a function of the
relative number fraction of the species, as set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture
nfrac</A> command.  If <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles of that species will always be added, and
a 13th depending on the value of a random number.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then a single target insertion number
<I>M</I> in a grid cell is calculated for all the species.  Each time a
particle is added, a random number is used to choose the species of
the particle, based on the relative number fractions of all the
species in the mixture.  As before, if <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will always be added, and a 13th
depending on the value of a random number.
</P>
<P>Here is a simple example that illustrates the difference between the
two options.  Assume a mixture with 2 species, each with a relative
number fraction of 0.5.  Assume a particular grid cell adds 10
particles from that mixture.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then
exactly 5 particles of each species will be added on every timestep
insertions take place.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then exactly
10 particles will be added every time and on average there will be 5
particles of each of the two species.  But on one timestep it might be
6 of the first and 4 of the second.  On another timestep it might be 3
of the first and 7 of the second.
</P>
<P>If the <I>region</I> keyword is used, then a particle will only added if
its position is within the specified <I>region-ID</I>.  This can be used to
only allow particle insertion on a subset of the boundary face.  Note
that the <I>side</I> option for the <A HREF = "region.html">region</A> command can be
used to define whether the inside or outside of the geometric region
is considered to be "in" the region.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the <I>region</I> and <I>n</I> keywords are used together,
less than N particles may be added on an insertion timestep.  This is
because grid cells will be candidates for particle insertion, unless
they are entirely outside the bounding box that encloses the region.
Particles those grid cells attempt to add are included in the count
for N, even if some or all of the particle insertions are rejected due
to not being inside the region.

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global vector of length 2 which can be accessed by
various output commands.  The first element of the vector is the total
number of particles added on the most recent insertion step.  The
second element is the cummulative total number added since the
beginning of the run.  The 2nd value is initialized to zero each time
a run is performed.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Particles cannot be emitted from periodic faces of the simulation box.
Particles cannot be emitted from <I>z</I> faces of the simluation box for a
2d simulation.
</P>
<P>A <I>n</I> setting of <I>Np</I> > 0 can only be used with a <I>perspecies</I> setting
of <I>no</I>.
</P>
<P>A warning will be issued if a specified face has an inward normal in a
direction opposing the streaming velocity.  This is because no
particles will be emitted from that face.
