[Description:]

Define a model for surface chemistry reactions to perform when
particles collide with surface elements or the global boundaries of
the simulation box.  One or more models can be defined and assigned to
different surfaces or simulation box boundaries via the
"surf_modify"_surf_modify.html or "bound_modify"_bound_modify.html
commands.  See "Section 6.9"_Section_howto.html#howto_9 for more
details of how SPARTA defines surfaces as collections of geometric
elements, triangles in 3d and line segments in 2d.  Also see the
"react"_react.html command for specification of a gas-phase chemistry
reaction model.

The ID for a surface reaction model is used to identify it in other
commands.  Each surface reaction model ID must be unique.  The ID can
only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.

For the {adsorb} style, particles are allowed to adsorb on the surface. 
These adsorbed particles can undergo reactions with other adsorbed particles 
as well as the gas-phase particles that strike the surface. When a particle
adsorbs on the surface, it is deleted and the number of adsorbed particles 
of that particular species is incremented. When a particle desorbs from the 
surface, a new particle is created and the count is decremented. The exact 
location of the adsorbed particles is not stored and they are assumed to 
uniformly distributed throughout the surface element. 

The surface reaction models for the {adsorb} style are described
below. There are two types of reactions in the {adsorb} style - 
gas-surface (GS) and pure-surface (PS). The GS reactions involve 
both gas-phase and adsorbed/bulk species as reactants. Hence GS 
reactions occur when gas particles collide with the surface. On 
the other hand, the PS reactions involve only adsorbed/bulk reactants
and do not include any gas-phase atoms or molecules. They are carried 
out at the end of every {nsync} timesteps based on the current value 
of surface coverage of the various adsorbed species. 

For GS reactions, when a particle collides with a surface element or boundary.
the list of all reactions possible with that species as the reactant
is looped over.  A probability for each reaction is calculated, using
the formulas discussed below, and a random number is used to decide
which reaction (if any) takes place.  A check is made that the sum of
probabilities for all possible reactions is <= 1.0, which should
normally be the case if reasonable reaction coefficients are defined.

For PS reactions, a time counter algorithm is used. Each reaction has a time counter 
{tau} that is increased by a value of {nsync*timestep} if all the reactants are 
available. The rate of each reaction {R} is computed based on the specified reaction 
rate constants as well as the surface coverage of the reactants. The product of the 
rate {R} and time counter {tau} is normalized to obtain the probability for each of 
reaction; and a random number is used to decide which reaction occurs. The chosen
reaction is perforemd and its time counter is modified as follows:

:c,image(Eqs/time_counter.png)

Now the probabilities of each reaction are recomputed and a new reaction is chosen based on
these probabilties and performed; and this process is repeated till the 
probability of all the reactions reaches zero. A detailed description can be found in 
Swaminathan Gopalan {et al.} "(SG18)"_#SG18.

IMPORTANT NOTE: A surface reaction model can not be specified for
surfaces whose surface collision style does not support reactions.
Currently this is only the {vanish} collision style.  See the
"surf_collide"_surf_collide.html doc page for details.

:line

For the {adsorb} style, one or two (for gs/ps option) file(s) is specified 
which contains a list of surface chemical reactions, with their associated 
parameters.  The reactions are read into SPARTA and stored in a list.  Each 
time a simulation is run via the "run"_run.html command, the list is scanned, 
and only active reactions are stored. In order for a reaction to be active, 
all the reactants and all the products must be currently defined as 
species-IDs; and also all the surface reactants and products must be present 
within the list of species that are allowed to adsorb on the surface.
This list of species is provided at the end of the surf_react adsorb command. 
Thus the file can contain more reactions than are used in a particular
simulation.  See the "species"_species.html command for how species
IDs are defined.  This style thus defines N reactions, where
N is the total number of reactions listed in the specified file(s).

As explained below each reaction has a specified probability between
0.0 and 1.0.  That probability is used to choose which reaction (if
any) is performed.

The format of the input surface reaction file is as follows.  Comments
or blank lines are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a
"#" character.  All other entries must come in 2 or more lines with
values separated by whitespace in the following format

R1(g) + R2(s) + R3(b) --> P1(g) + P2(s) + P3(b)
reaction-type reaction-style C1 C2 ... 
scattering-model args :pre

The first line is a text-based description of a single reaction. R1, R2, and 
R3 are the reactants; while P1, P2, and P3 are the products listed as a 
"species"_species.html IDs. The phase of the 
reactants and products are species in the brackets right next to the species ID. 
It can be one of the following

(g) - gas phase = gas particle striking or scattering from the surface
(s) - surface phase = adsorbed particle present on the surface
(b) - bulk phase = material with which the surface is made of :pre

For a GS reaction R1 must be a gas-phase reactant - the particle that collides 
with the surface/boundary. For a PS reaction R1 must be an adsorbed or bulk-phase species. 

Individual reactants and products must be separated by whitespace
and a "+" sign. The left-hand and right-hand sides of the equation must be separated
by whitespace and "-->". 
The {type} of each reaction is a string of characters (upper or lower
case). The different types of GS and PS reactions are described below.

:line

The list of GS reactions is as follows:

AA = Associative Adsorption
DA = Dissociative Adsorption
LH1 = Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism of type 1
LH3 = Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism of type 3 
CD = Condensation reaction
ER = Eley-Rideal mechanism 
CI = Collision-induced reaction :ul

An associative adsorption reaction means that R1(g) adsorbs on the surface to form P1(s)
when it collides with the surface/boundary. 

A dissociative adsorption reaction means that R1(g) dissociates when it collides with the 
surface/boundary. One or more of the dissociated products can adsorb on the surface 
and the rest of them scatter as gas-phase products. 

A Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction of type 1 means that R1(g) adsorbs on the surface when it 
collides with the surface/boundary, and reacts quickly with the adsorbed species R2(s) or 
bulk-phase species R2(b) on the surface to form gas-phase product P1(g).  

A Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction of type 3 means that R1(g) adsorbs on the surface when it 
collides with the surface/boundary, and reacts quickly with the adsorbed species R2(s) or 
bulk-phase species R2(b) on the surface to form adsorbed product P1(s).

A condensation reaction means that R1(g) coalesces with the bulk material with which the
surface is made of, when it collides with the surface/boundary to form bulk-phase product
P1(b). 

An Eley-Rideal reaction means that R1(g) reacts quickly with adsorbed species R2(s) or bulk 
species R2(b) when it collides with the surface/boundary to form gas-phase product P1(g).

A collision-induced reaction means that R1(g) causes the desorption of adsorbed species R2(s)
when it collides with the surface/boundary to form gas-phase products P1(g) (same species as
R2). The incident gas-phase particle can either adsorb P2(s) or scatter from the surface P2(g)
post collision. 

A detailed description of the various types of reactions can be found in 
Swaminathan Gopalan {et al.} "(SG18)"_#SG18. 
Here is a table of examples for each type of GS reaction.

The list of PS reactions is as follows:

DS = Desorption reaction
LH2 = Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism of type 2
LH4 = Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism of type 4 
SB = Sublimation reaction :ul

A desorption reaction means that R1(s) desorbs from the surface to form P1(g) whose final 
velocities are determined by the provided scattering model. 

A Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction of type 2 means that R1(s) adsorbed on the surface reacts
with another adsorbed species R2(s) or bulk-phase species R2(b) on the surface to form 
gas-phase product P1(g).  

A Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction of type 4 means that R1(s) adsorbed on the surface reacts
with another adsorbed species R2(s) or bulk-phase species R2(b) on the surface to form 
adsorbed product P1(s).  

A sublimation reaction means that R1(b), the bulk material undergoes a transformation from 
solid to gas, to form gas-phase product P1(g). 

A detailed description of the various types of reactions can be found in 
Swaminathan Gopalan {et al.} "(SG18)"_#SG18. 
Here is a table of examples for each type of PS reaction.

:line 

The {style} of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower
case) with the following meaning:

S = Simple
A = Arrhenius :ul

The style determines how many reaction coefficients are listed as C1,
C2, etc, and how they are interpreted by SPARTA.

For S = Simple style, there is a single coefficient:

C1 = direct value for the reaction rate constant :pre


For A = Arrhenius style, there are three coefficients:

A = pre-expoential factor 
b = temperature exponent 
Ea = activation energy for the reaction :pre

The reaction rate constant is calculated in the following manner: 

:c,image(Eqs/arrhenius_2.png)

For all the reactions which includes adsorption - AA, DA, LH1, LH3, and CD; the user must 
specify the number of species that adsorb on the surface for the reaction as a argument 
after the reaction rate coefficients

Additional optional keywords for GS reactions can be used to define the reaction rate constant. 
These are {kisliuk}: proposed by Kisliuk "(Kisliuk57)"_#Kisliuk57;
and {energy}: proposed by Beckerle {et al.} "(Beckerle89)"_#Beckerle89; options :b

{kisliuk} args = a_k b_k Ea_k (only for reactions which includes adsorption - AA, DA, LH1, LH3, and CD)
    {A_k} = pre-expoential factor
    {b_k} = temperature exponent
    {Ea_k} = activation energy for the adsorption :pre
:ule

:c,image(Eqs/k_kisliuk.png)

{energy} args = m n (only for CI) :b
  {m} = energy exponent
  {n} = polar angle exponent :pre
:ule

:c,image(Eqs/k_energy.png)

The final rate of the reaction is computed by the product of the reaction rate constant and the
surface coverage of all the adsorbed reactants. The reaction probability is obtained by normalized all the 
reaction rates. A detailed description can be found in Swaminathan Gopalan {et al.} "(SG18)"_#SG18.

:line

If there are gas-phase products, the user has an option of specifying the 
model by the particle scatters from the surface, which can be different 
from the surface collision model assigned to the surface element using the "surf_collide"_surf_collide.html
command. Any of the following surface collision models can be used: 
{specular}, {diffuse}, {cll}, {impulsive}, {td}. The scattering model style
and the corresponding arguments are specified in the next line after the 
reaction-style. If there are two gas-phase products, the scattering model 
for the second particle is defined in a new line. The arguments for the different 
surface scattering models is similar to the "surf_collide"_surf_collide.html 
command. If the user does not wish to specify a scattering model, {NULL} keyword
can be specified.

:line

[Output info:]

All the surface reaction models calculate a global vector of values.
The values can be used by the "stats_style"_stats_style.html command
and by "variables"_variable.html that define formulas.  The latter
means they can be used by any command that uses a variable as input,
e.g. the "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html command.  See "Section
4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The {adsorb} styles each compute a vector of length 2 +
2*nlist. For the {adsorb} style, nlist is the sum of both the gas-surface 
and pure-surface reactions listed in the file is read as input.

The first element of the vector is the count of particles that
performed surface reactions for surface elements assigned to this
reaction model during the current timestep. The second element is the
cummulative count of particles that have performed reactions since the
beginning of the current run.  The next nlist elements are the count
of each individual reaction that occurred during the current timestep.
The final nlist elements are the cummulative count of each individual
reaction since the beginning of the current run.
