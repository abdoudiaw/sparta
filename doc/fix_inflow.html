<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Insert particles into the simulation box continuously during a
simulation.  The particles are inserted on the specified faces using
properties of the specified mixture.  If done every timestep, this has
the effect of a continuous influx of particles thru the face(s).
</P>
<P>The properties of the inserted particles are from the mixture with ID
<I>mix-ID</I>.  This determines what particle species are in the mixture at
what relative fractions, and its number density, streaming velocity,
and temperature.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>One or more faces of the simulation box can be specified via the
<I>face1</I>, <I>face2</I>, etc arguments.  There are 6 individual faces that
can be specified as <I>xlo</I>, <I>xhi</I>, <I>ylo</I>, <I>yhi</I>, <I>zlo</I>, or <I>zhi</I>.
Specifying <I>all</I> is the same as specifying all 6 individual faces.
</P>
<P>On each insertion timestep, each grid cell with a face(s) on an inflow
boundary performs the following computation at the beginning of the
SPARTA timestep.
</P>
<P>The molecular flux across a surface element per unit time is given by
equation 4.22 of Bird 1994.  Based on that, the number of particles
<I>M</I> to insert on the face is based on the number of molecules
enetring, the global <I>fnum</I> ratio (specified by the
<A HREF = "global.html"">global</A> command, the mixture number density, the mixture
streaming velocity and thermal temperature, the area of the face, and
its orientation relative to the streaming velocity.
</P>
<P>If <I>M</I> has a fractional value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles are
inserted, and a 13th depending on the outcome of a random number
generation.  Each particle is inserted at a random location on the
face.  The particle species is chosen randomly in accord with the
<I>frac</I> settings of the collection of species in the mixture, as set by
the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  The velocity of the particle is
set to the sum of the streaming velocity of the mixture and a thermal
velocity sampled from the thermal temperature of the mixture.  Both
the streaming velocity and thermal temperature are also set by the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.
</P>
<P>If the final particle velocity is not directed "into" the grid cell,
then the velocity sampling is repeated until it is.  This insures that
all inserted particles enter the simulation domain, as desired.
</P>
<P>The first timestep that inserted particles are advected, they move for
a random fraction of the timestep.  This insures a continuous flow
field of particles entering the simulation box through the box face.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>n</I> keyword can be useful for debugging purposes.  If <I>Np</I> is set
to 0, then the number of inserted particles is a function of <I>fnum</I>,
<I>nrho</I>, and other mixture settings, as described above.  If <I>Np</I> is set
to a value > 0, then the <I>fnum</I> and <I>nrho</I> settings are ignored, and
<I>Np</I> particles are inserted.  This is done by dividing <I>Np</I> by the
total number of grid cells that are adjacent to the specified box
faces and inserting an equal number of particles per grid cell.
</P>
<P>The <I>nevery</I> keyword determines how often particles are inserted.  If
<I>Nstep</I> > 1, this may give a non-continuous, clumpy distribution in
the inlet flow field.
</P>
<P>The <I>perspecies</I> keyword determines how the species of each inserted
particle is randomly determined.  This has an effect on the
statistical properties of the inserted particles.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then a target insertion number <I>M</I> is
calculated for each species in a grid cell, which is a function of the
relative number fraction of the species, as set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture
nfrac</A> command.  If <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles of that species will always be inserted,
and a 13th depending on the outcome of a randomly generated number.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then a single target insertion number
<I>M</I> is calculated for all the species in a grid cell.  Each time a
particle is inserted, a random number is used to choose the species of
the particle, based on the relative number fractions of all the
species in the mixture.  As before, if <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will always be inserted, and a 13th
depending on the outcome of a randomly generated number.
</P>
<P>Here is a simple example, illustrating the difference between the two
options.  Assume a mixture with 2 species, each with a relative number
fraction of 0.5.  Assume a particular grid cell inserts 10 particles
from that mixture.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then exactly 5
particles of each species will be inserted on every timestep
insertions take place.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then exactly
10 particles will be inserted every time and on average the insertion
will be 5 particles of each of the two species.  But on one timestep
it might be 6 of the first and 4 of the second.  On another timestep
it might be 3 of the first and 7 of the second.

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global vector of length 2 which can be accessed by
various output commands.  The first element of the vector is the total
number of particles inserted on the most recent insertion step.  The
second element is the cummulative total number inserted since the
beginning of the run.  The 2nd value is initialized to zero each time
a run is performed.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Particles cannot be inserted on <I>z</I> faces of the simluation box for a
2d simulation.  Particles cannot be inserted on periodic faces of the
simulation box.
</P>
<P>A <I>n</I> setting of <I>Np</I> > 0 can only be used with a <I>perspecies</I> setting
of <I>no</I>.
