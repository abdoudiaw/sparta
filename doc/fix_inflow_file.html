<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Insert particles into the simulation box continuously during a
simulation.  The particles are inserted on one face of the box using
properties of the specified mixture and values from an input file.
The latter can be used to create a flow that varies spatially over the
face surface.  This can be useful, for example, for modeling an object
inserted into a plume flow with spatially varying properties.  If
invoked every timestep, this fix induces a continuous influx of
particles thru the face.
</P>
<P>The properties of the inserted particles are derived from the mixture
with ID <I>mix-ID</I> and the input file.  Together they determine the
number and species of added particles, as well as their streaming
velocity, thermal temperature, and internal energy modes.  The details
are explained below.
</P>
<P>One face of the simulation box can be specified via the <I>face</I>
argument.  The 6 possible faces are <I>xlo</I>, <I>xhi</I>, <I>ylo</I>, <I>yhi</I>, <I>zlo</I>,
or <I>zhi</I>.
</P>
<P>On each insertion timestep, each grid cell with a face touching the
inflow boundary performs the following computations to insert
particles.  The insertion occus at the beginning of the SPARTA
timestep.
</P>
<P>The molecular flux across a grid cell face per unit time is given by
equation 4.22 of <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>.  The number of particles <I>M</I> to
insert on a particular grid cell face is based on this flux and
additional global, flow, and cell face properties:
</P>
<UL><LI>global property: <I>fnum</I> ratio as specified by the <A HREF = "global.html"">global</A> command
<LI>flow properties: number density, streaming velocity, and thermal temperature
<LI>cell face properties: area of face and its orientation relative to the streaming velocity 
</UL>
<P>The flow properties are defined for the specified mixture via the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  Any or all them can be overridden by
spatially varying values in the input data file, which affect
individual grid cells as described below.
</P>
<P>If <I>M</I> has a fractional value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles are
inserted, and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.  Each
particle is inserted at a random location on the grid cell face.  The
particle species is chosen randomly in accord with the <I>frac</I> settings
of the collection of species in the mixture, as set by the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  These can also be overridden by
spatially varying fractional values in the input data file, as
described below.
</P>
<P>The velocity of the particle is set to the sum of the streaming
velocity and a thermal velocity sampled from the thermal temperature.
The internal energy modes of the particle are determined by the
thermal temperature and the <I>rotate</I> and <I>vibrate</I> options of the
<A HREF = "collide_modify.html">collide_modify</A> command.  Note that if the
<A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command has not been specified (free molecular
flow), then no rotational or vibrational energy will be assigned to
created particles.
</P>
<P>If the final particle velocity is not directed "into" the grid cell,
then the velocity sampling procedure is repeated until it is.  This
insures that all inserted particles enter the simulation domain, as
desired.
</P>
<P>The first timestep that inserted particles are advected, they move for
a random fraction of the timestep.  This insures a continuous flow
field of particles entering the simulation box.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For 3d simulations, the input data file defines a regular 2d grid of
data points which conceptually overlays the entire face of the
simulation box.  For a 2d simulation, a 1d grid is defined.  The grid
can have uniform or non-uniform spacing in each of its two dimensions.
One or more values can be defined at the grid points, which override
any of the mixture settings defined by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A>
command.  These are the flow properties discussed above (number
density, streaming velocity, and thermal temperature), as well as the
number fraction of any species in the mixture.  Any value not
specified in the input data file defaults to the mixture value for all
grid points.
</P>
<P>The 2d grid is defined in the file using I,J indices.  I and J map to
the simulation box face in this manner.  Any simulation box face
involves has two varying dimensions (e.g. ylo = varying x and z
values).  I corresponds to the "lowest" of these dimensions, where x <
y < z.  J corresponds to the higher.  Thus for face ylo, I = x and J =
z.  A low I or J value corresponds to a low x or z value, regardless
of whether the mapping is to the ylo or yhi face.  A 1d grid for a 2d
simulation is defined in an analogous manner.
</P>
<P>The I,J grid points cover the entire 2d box face.  For a 2d
simulation, the I grid points cover the entire 1d box edge.  This
means grid points (1,1), (1,Nj), (Ni,1), (Ni,Nj) map to the 4 corner
points of the face.  The other grid points have fractional I,J
coordinates (0.0 to 1.0) which map to points at fractional locations
within the box face.
</P>
<P>Interpolation to a grid cell face of any value defined on the 2d grid
is done in the following way.  The centroid (center pt) of the grid
cell face is surrounded geometrically by 4 grid points.  The 4 values,
e.g. for <I>nrho</I>, defined on those 4 grid points are averaged in a
weighted manner to determine the <I>nrho</I> for the grid cell face.  This
average <I>nrho</I> value is used for the calculation described above for
<I>M</I> = the number of particles to insert on the cell face.
</P>
<P>The format of the input data file is a series of one or more sections,
defined as follows (without the parenthesized comments).  Note that
one file can contain many sections, each with a different set of
tabulated boundary values.  SPARTA reads the file section by section
until it finds one that matches the specified boundary-ID.
</P>
<PRE># plume ABC info           (one or more comment or blank lines)

</PRE>
<P>This format is for a 3d simulation.  For a 2d simulation, there are 3
changes:
</P>
<UL><LI>"NIJ 4 10" is replaced by "NI 6"
<LI>the JGRID line is not allowed
<LI>"I,J,value,..." is replaced by "I,value,..." 
</UL>
<P>A section begins with a non-blank line whose first character is not a
"#"; blank lines or lines starting with "#" can be used as comments
between sections.  The first line begins with a boundary-ID which
identifies the section.  The line can contain additional text, but the
initial text must match the boundary-ID specified in the fix
inflow/file command.  Otherwise the section is skipped.
</P>
<P>The next 3 lines must list NIJ, NV, VALUES (or NI for a 2d
simulation).  The VALUES line lists Nv keywords.  The list of possible
keywords to include is as follows, along with the meaning of the
numeric value specified for the grid point:
</P>
<UL><LI>nrho = number density
<LI>vstream = 3 components of streaming velocity
<LI>temp = thermal temperature
<LI>species = number fraction of any species in the mixture 
</UL>
<P>The IGRID and JGRID lines are each optional.  If not specified, the
grid has uniform spacing in the I or J directions.  If specified, Ni
or Nj values must follow.  These are fractional values, each from 0.0
to 1.0 inclusive.  The values must be monotonically increasing with
the first and last values = 0.0 and 1.0 respectively.
</P>
<P>Following a blank line, the next N = Ni x Nj lines (or N = Ni lines
for a 2d simulation) list the tabulated values.  The format of each
line is I,J followed by Nv values.  The N lines can be in any order,
but all unique I,J indices must be listed.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>nevery</I> keyword determines how often particles are inserted.  If
<I>Nstep</I> > 1, this may give a non-continuous, clumpy distribution in
the inlet flow field.
</P>
<P>The <I>frac</I> keyword can alter how many particles are inserted, which
can be useful for debugging purposes.  If <I>frac</I> is set to 1.0 (the
default) then the number of particles inserted is the sum of the <I>M</I>
value for each grid cell touching the inflow face, as described above.
If <I>frac</I> < 1.0 then <I>M</I> is scaled by frac to determine the number of
particles inserted in each grid cell.  Thus a simulation with less
particles can easily be run to test if it is setup correctly.
</P>
<P>The <I>perspecies</I> keyword determines how the species of each inserted
particle is randomly determined.  This has an effect on the
statistical properties of inserted particles.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then a target insertion number <I>M</I> in
a grid cell is calculated for each species, which is a function of the
relative number fraction of the species, as set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture
nfrac</A> command.  If <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles of that species will always be inserted,
and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then a single target insertion number
<I>M</I> in a grid cell is calculated for all the species.  Each time a
particle is inserted, a random number is used to choose the species of
the particle, based on the relative number fractions of all the
species in the mixture.  As before, if <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will always be inserted, and a 13th
depending on the value of a random number.
</P>
<P>Here is a simple example that illustrates the difference between the
two options.  Assume a mixture with 2 species, each with a relative
number fraction of 0.5.  Assume a particular grid cell inserts 10
particles from that mixture.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then
exactly 5 particles of each species will be inserted on every timestep
insertions take place.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then exactly
10 particles will be inserted every time and on average the insertion
will be 5 particles of each of the two species.  But on one timestep
it might be 6 of the first and 4 of the second.  On another timestep
it might be 3 of the first and 7 of the second.

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global vector of length 2 which can be accessed by
various output commands.  The first element of the vector is the total
number of particles inserted on the most recent insertion step.  The
second element is the cummulative total number inserted since the
beginning of the run.  The 2nd value is initialized to zero each time
a run is performed.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
