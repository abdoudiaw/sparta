<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Insert particles into the simulation box continuously during a
simulation.  The particles are inserted on one face of the box using
properties of the specified mixture and values read from an input file
that can override those properties.  The input file can thus be used
to create a flow that varies spatially over the face surface.  This
can be useful, for example, to model an object inserted into a plume
flow where the flow has spatially varying properties.  If invoked
every timestep, this fix induces a continuous influx of particles thru
the face.
</P>
<P>The properties of the inserted particles are derived from the mixture
with ID <I>mix-ID</I> and the input file.  Together they determine the
number and species of added particles, as well as their streaming
velocity, thermal temperature, and internal energy modes.  The details
are explained below.
</P>
<P>Only one face of the simulation box can be specified via the <I>face</I>
argument.  The 6 possible faces are <I>xlo</I>, <I>xhi</I>, <I>ylo</I>, <I>yhi</I>, <I>zlo</I>,
or <I>zhi</I>.  This command can be used multiple times to insert particles
on multiple faces.
</P>
<P>On each insertion timestep, each grid cell with a face touching the
inflow boundary performs the following computations to insert
particles.  The insertion occus at the beginning of the SPARTA
timestep.
</P>
<P>The molecular flux across a grid cell face per unit time is given by
equation 4.22 of <A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A>.  The number of particles <I>M</I> to
insert on a particular grid cell face is based on this flux and
additional global, flow, and cell face properties:
</P>
<UL><LI>global property: <I>fnum</I> ratio as specified by the <A HREF = "global.html"">global</A> command
<LI>flow properties: number density, streaming velocity, and thermal temperature
<LI>cell face properties: area of face and its orientation relative to the streaming velocity 
</UL>
<P>The flow properties are defined for the specified mixture via the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  Any or all them can be overridden by
values in the input data file, which affect individual grid cells as
described below.
</P>
<P>If <I>M</I> has a fractional value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles are
inserted, and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.  Each
particle is inserted at a random location on the grid cell face.  The
particle species is chosen randomly in accord with the <I>frac</I> settings
of the collection of species in the mixture, as set by the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  These can also be overridden by
spatially varying number fraction values in the input data file, as
described below.
</P>
<P>The velocity of the particle is set to the sum of the streaming
velocity and a thermal velocity sampled from the thermal temperature.
The internal energy modes of the particle are determined by the
thermal temperature and the <I>rotate</I> and <I>vibrate</I> options of the
<A HREF = "collide_modify.html">collide_modify</A> command.  Note that if the
<A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command has not been specified (free molecular
flow), then no rotational or vibrational energy will be assigned to
created particles.
</P>
<P>If the final particle velocity is not directed "into" the grid cell,
then the velocity sampling procedure is repeated until it is.  This
insures that all inserted particles enter the simulation domain, as
desired.
</P>
<P>The first timestep that inserted particles are advected, they move for
a random fraction of the timestep.  This insures a continuous flow
field of particles entering the simulation box.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For 3d simulations, the input data file defines a 2d mesh of data
points which conceptually overlays some portion or all of the
specified face of the simulation box.  For a 2d simulation, a 1d mesh
is defined.  The mesh is topologically regular, but can have uniform
or non-uniform spacing in each of its two or one dimensions (for 3d or
2d problems).  One or more values can be defined at every mesh point,
which override any of the mixture settings defined by the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  These are the flow properties
discussed above (number density, streaming velocity, and thermal
temperature), as well as the number fraction of any species in the
mixture.  Any value not defined in the input data file defaults to the
mixture value.
</P>
<P>For 3d simulations, a 2d mesh is defined in the file using I,J
indices.  (The 1d mesh for 2d simulations is described below).  I and
J map to any of the simulation box faces in this manner.  A simulation
box face has two varying dimensions (e.g. ylo face = x and z
dimensions).  The I index in the file corresponds to the "lowest" of
these dimensions, where x < y < z.  The J index in the file
corresponds to the higher.  Thus for face ylo, I = x and J = z.  A low
I or J value corresponds to a low x or z value, regardless of whether
the mapping is to the ylo or yhi face.  A 1d mesh for a 2d simulation
is defined in an analogous manner, e.g. for face xlo, I = y.
</P>
<P>For a 3d simulation, interpolation from values on the 2d mesh to any
grid cell face that is on the corresponding simulation box face is
done in the following manner.  There are 3 cases to consider.
</P>
<P>(a) For a grid cell face that is entirely inside the area defined by
the file mesh, the centroid (center point) of the grid cell face is
surrounded geometrically by 4 file mesh points.  The 4 values defined
on those 4 file points are averaged in a weighted manner using
bilinear interpolation (described below) to determine the value for
the grid cell face.  This value is then used for the calculation
described above for <I>M</I> = the number of particles to insert on the
cell face as well as the properties of the inserted particles.
</P>
<P>(b) For a grid cell face that is entirely outside the area defined by
the file mesh, no particles are inserted in that grid cell.
</P>
<P>(c) For a grid cell face that partially overlaps the area defined by
the file mesh, the extent of the overlap is computed.  The centroid
(center point) of the overlap area is surrounded geometrically by 4
file mesh points.  The values for those 4 points are used as in (a)
above to determine properties of particles inserted in that grid cell.
Note that the area of insertion, used to calculate <I>M</I>, is the overlap
area, which is smaller than the grid cell face area.  Also, particles
are only inserted within the overlap area of the grid cell face.
</P>
<P>For a 2d simulation, the 3 cases are similar, except for (a) and (c)
the centroid is the midpoint of a line segment, the centroid is
surrounded by 2 file mesh points, and linear interpolation (described
below) is performed to determine the value for the grid face.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The format of the input data file is a series of one or more sections,
defined as follows (without the parenthesized comments).  Note that
one file can contain many sections, each with a different set of
tabulated values.  The sections can be a mix of 2d and 3d formats.
SPARTA reads the file section by section, skipping sections with
non-matching boundary IDs, until it finds one that matches the
specified boundary-ID.  The lines that follow must be in this order:
</P>
<PRE># plume ABC info           (one or more comment or blank lines) 
</PRE>
<PRE>PLUME_ABC                  (boundary-ID is first word on line)
NIJ 4 10                   (mesh size: Ni by Nj)
NV 3                       (Nv = number of values per mesh point)
VALUES nrho temp Ar        (list of Nv values per mesh point)
IMESH 0.0 0.3 0.9 1.0      (mesh coordinates in I direction)
JMESH ...                  (mesh coordinates in J direction)
                           (blank)
1 1 1.0 300.0 0.5          (I, J, value1, value2, ...)
1 2 1.02 310.0 0.5           
...
4 10 3.0 400.0 0.7 
</PRE>
<P>This format is for a 3d simulation.  For a 2d simulation, there are 3
changes:
</P>
<UL><LI>"NIJ 4 10" is replaced by "NI 6"
<LI>JMESH line is not included
<LI>"I,J,value1,..." is replaced by "I,value1,..." 
</UL>
<P>A section begins with a non-blank line whose first character is not a
"#".  Blank lines or lines starting with "#" can be used as comments
between sections.  The first line begins with a boundary-ID which
identifies the section.  The line can contain additional text, but the
initial text must match the boundary-ID specified in the fix
inflow/file command.  Otherwise the section is skipped.
</P>
<P>The VALUES line lists Nv keywords.  The list of possible keywords is
as follows, along with the meaning of the numeric value specified for
the mesh point:
</P>
<UL><LI>nrho = number density
<LI>vstream = 3 components of streaming velocity
<LI>temp = thermal temperature
<LI>species = number fraction of any species in the mixture 
</UL>
<P>The IMESH and JMESH lines must list values that are monotonically
increasing.
</P>
<P>Following a blank line, the next N = Ni x Nj lines (or N = Ni lines
for a 2d simulation) list the tabulated values.  The format of each
line is I,J followed by Nv values.  The N lines can be in any order,
but all unique I,J (or I for 2d) indices must be listed.
</P>
<P>Note that if number fractions are specified for one or more species in
the mixture, then they override number fraction values for the mixture
itself, as set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  However, for
each grid cell, the rule that the number fraction of all species in
the mixture must sum to 1.0 is enforced, just as it is for the
mixture.  This means that number fractions of species not specified in
the file or in the mixture may be reset (for that grid cell) to insure
the sum = 1.0, as explained on the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command doc
page.  If this cannot be done, an error will be generated.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For 3d simulations, bilinear interpolation from the 2d mesh of values
specified in the file is performed using this equation to calculate
the value at the centroid point (i,j) in the grid cell face:
</P>
<PRE>f(i,j) = 1/area * (f(i1,j1)*(i2-i)*(j2-j) + f(i2,j1)*(i-i1)*(j2-j) +
                   f(i2,j2)*(i-i1)*(j-j1) + f(i1,j2)*(i2-i)*(j-j1)) 
</PRE>
<P>where the 4 surrounding file mesh points are (i1,j1), (i2,j1),
(i2,j2), and (i1,j2).  The 4 f() values on the right-hand side are the
values defined at the file mesh points.  The sum is normalized by the
area of the overlap between the grid cell face and file mesh.
</P>
<P>For 2d simulations, linear interpolation from the 1d mesh of values
specified in the file is performed using this equation to calculate
the value at the centroid poitn (i) in the grid cell line:
</P>
<PRE>f(i) = 1/length * (f(i1)*(i2-i) + f(i2)*(i-i1)
     = f(i1) + (i - i1)/(i2 - i1) * (f(i2) - f(i1)) 
</PRE>
<P>where the 2 surrounding file mesh points are (i1) and (i2).  The 2 f()
values on the right-hand side are the values defined at the file mesh
points.  The sum is normalized by the length of the overlap between
the grid cell line and file mesh.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>frac</I> keyword can alter how many particles are inserted, which
can be useful for debugging purposes.  If <I>frac</I> is set to 1.0 (the
default) then the number of particles inserted is the sum of the <I>M</I>
values computed for each grid cell that overlaps with the mesh defined
in the file, as described above.  If <I>frac</I> < 1.0 then <I>M</I> is scaled
by frac to determine the number of particles inserted in each grid
cell.  Thus a simulation with less particles can easily be run to test
if it is setup correctly.
</P>
<P>The <I>nevery</I> keyword determines how often particles are inserted.  If
<I>Nstep</I> > 1, this may give a non-continuous, clumpy distribution in
the inlet flow field.
</P>
<P>The <I>perspecies</I> keyword determines how the species of each inserted
particle is randomly determined.  This has an effect on the
statistical properties of inserted particles.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then a target insertion number <I>M</I> in
a grid cell is calculated for each species, which is a function of the
relative number fraction of the species, as set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture
nfrac</A> command.  If <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles of that species will always be inserted,
and a 13th depending on the value of a random number.
</P>
<P>If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then a single target insertion number
<I>M</I> in a grid cell is calculated for all the species.  Each time a
particle is inserted, a random number is used to choose the species of
the particle, based on the relative number fractions of all the
species in the mixture.  As before, if <I>M</I> has a fractional value,
e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will always be inserted, and a 13th
depending on the value of a random number.
</P>
<P>Here is a simple example that illustrates the difference between the
two options.  Assume a mixture with 2 species, each with a relative
number fraction of 0.5.  Assume a particular grid cell inserts 10
particles from that mixture.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>yes</I>, then
exactly 5 particles of each species will be inserted on every timestep
insertions take place.  If <I>perspecies</I> is set to <I>no</I>, then exactly
10 particles will be inserted every time and on average the insertion
will be 5 particles of each of the two species.  But on one timestep
it might be 6 of the first and 4 of the second.  On another timestep
it might be 3 of the first and 7 of the second.

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global vector of length 2 which can be accessed by
various output commands.  The first element of the vector is the total
number of particles inserted on the most recent insertion step.  The
second element is the cummulative total number inserted since the
beginning of the run.  The 2nd value is initialized to zero each time
a run is performed.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Particles cannot be inserted on <I>z</I> faces of the simluation box for a
2d simulation.  Particles cannot be inserted on periodic faces of the
simulation box.
</P>
<P>Unlike the <A HREF = "fix_inflow.html">fix inflow</A> command, no warning is issued
if the specified inflow face has an inward normal in a direction
opposing the streaming velocity, as defined by the mixture.  This is
because the streaming velocity as defined by the specified mixture may
be overridden by values in the file.  Note that if the streaming
velocity for a particular grid cell face does oppose the inward
normal, no particles will be inserted in that grid cell.
