react command :h3

[Syntax:]

react style args :pre

style = {none} or {tce} or {qk} :ulb,l
args = arguments for that style :l
  {none} args = none
  {tce} args = infile
    infile = file with list of chemical reactions
  {qk} args = infile
    infile = file with list of chemical reactions :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

react none
react tce air.tce :pre

[Description:]

Define chemical reactions to perform when particle-particle collisions
occur.

The {none} style means that no chemistry will be performed, which is
the default.

For other styles, a file is specified which contains a list of
chemical reactions, with their associated parameters.  The reactions
are read into SPARTA and stored in a list.  Each time a simulation is
run via the "run"_run.html command, the list is scanned.  Only
reactions for which all the reactants and all the products are
currently defined as species-IDs will be active for the simulation.
Thus the file can contain more reactions than are used in a particular
simulation.  See the "species"_species.html command for how species
IDs are defined.

The reaction models for the various styles and the corresponding input
file format are described below.

:line

The {tce} style is Bird's Total Collision Energy Model.  Using kinetic
theory, it allows for reaction probabilities to be defined based on
known, measured, reaction rates.  The model is described in detail in
"(Bird94)"_#Bird94; see chapter 6. The required input is an
Arrhenius-type rate for each reaction

:c,image(Eqs/arrhenius.jpg)

where k_f is the forward reaction rate, T is the Temperature and k 
the Boltzman constant.

The format of the input file is as follows.  Comments or blank lines
are allowed in the file.  Comment lines start with a "#" character.
All other entries must come in 2-line pairs with values separated by
whitespace in the following format

R1 + R2 + ... --> P1 + P2 + ...
type style C1 C2 ... :pre

The data directory in the SPARTA distribution contains reaction files
for the TCE model, all with the suffix ".tce".

The first line is a text-based description of a single reaction.  R1,
R2, etc are one or more reactants, listed as "species"_species.html
IDs.  P1, P2, etc are one or more products, also listed as
"species"_species.html IDs.  The number of allowed reactants and
products depends on the reaction type, as discussed below.  Individual
reactants and products must be separated by whitespace and a "+" sign.
The left-hand and right-hand sides of the equation must be separated
by whitespace and "-->".

The {type} of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower
case) with the following meaning.  The type determines how many
reactants and products can be specified in the first line.

D = dissociation = 2 reactants and 3 products
E = exchange = 2 reactants and 2 products
I = ionization = 2 reactants and 2 or 3 products
R = recombination :pre

A dissociation reaction means that R1 dissociates into P1 and P2 when
it collides with R2.  R2 is preserved in the collision, so P3 = R2 is
required.

An exchange reaction is a collision between R1 and R2 that results in
new products P1 and P2.  There is no restriction on the species
involved in the reaction.

An ionization reaction with 2 products is typically a collision
between R1 and R2 that results in a positively charged ion and an
election.  However, SPARTA does not check for this, so there is no
restriction on the species involved in the reaction.

An ionization reaction with 3 products is typically a collision
between a neutral R1 and an electon R2 which ejects an electron from
the neutral species, resulting in P1 and P2.  R2 is preserved in the
collision, so P3 = R2 is required.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Ionization and recombination reactions have not yet
been implemented in SPARTA.

The {style} of each reaction is a single character (upper or lower
case) with the following meaning:

A = Arrhenius :ul

The style determines how many reaction coefficients are listed as C1,
C2, ..., and how they are interpreted by SPARTA.

For the A = Arrhenius style, there are 5 coefficients:

C1 = number of internal degrees of freedom (as defined by the TCE model)
C2 = activation Energy $E_a$ 
C3 = Arrhenius Rate A
C4 = Arrhenius rate b
C5 = reaction energy (positive for exothermic) :ul

:line

The {qk} style is Bird's Quantum-Kinetic model (QK).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The QK model has not yet been implemented in SPARTA.
