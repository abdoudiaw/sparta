compute ke/particle command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID ke/particle :pre

ID is documented in "compute"_compute.html command
ke/particle = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 ke/particle :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the per-atom translational
kinetic energy for each particle.

The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
"dump particle"_dump.html command.

The kinetic energy is

Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
KE = 1/2 m Vsq

where m is the mass and (Vx,Vy,Vz) are the velocity components of the
particle.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per-particle vector, which can be accessed
by any command that uses per-particle values from a compute as input.

The vector can be accessed by any command that uses per-particle
values from a compute as input.  See "Section
4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The per-particle vector values will be in energy "units"_units.html.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"dump particle"_dump.html

[Default:] none
