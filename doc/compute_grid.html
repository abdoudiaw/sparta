<PRE>compute 1 grid species n u v w usq vsq wsq
compute 1 grid air n u v w 
</PRE>
<P>These commands will dump time averages for each species and each grid
cell to a dump file every 1000 steps:
</P>
<PRE>compute 1 grid species n u v w usq vsq wsq

dump 1 grid all 1000 tmp.grid id f_1 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates one or more values for each grid
cell, based on the particles in the cell.  The values are tallied
separately for each group of species in the specified mixture, as
described in the Ouput section below.  See the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A>
command for how a set of species can be partitioned into groups.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  The values for a single timestep can be output by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command.
</P>
<P>The values over many sampling timesteps can be averaged by the <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix
ave/grid</A> command.  It does its averaging as if the
particles in the cell at each sampling timestep were combined together
into one large set of particles to compute the formulas below.  Note
that this is a different form of averaging than taking the values
produced by the formulas below for a single timestep, summing those
values over the sampling timesteps, and then dividing by the number of
sampling steps.  Except for the <I>n</I> and <I>nrho</I> values where the two
averaging methods are identical.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>n</I> value counts the number of particles in each group.
</P>
<P>The <I>nrho</I> value computes the number density of particles in each
group:
</P>
<P>Nrho = N * fnum / volume
</P>
<P>N is the number of particles (same as the <I>n</I> keyword), fnum is the
real/simulated particle ratio set by the <A HREF = "global.html">global fnum</A>
command, and volume is the flow volume of the grid cell.
</P>
<P>The <I>nfrac</I> value computes the number fraction of particles in each
group:
</P>
<P>Nfrac = Ngroup / Ntotal
</P>
<P>Ngroup is the count of particles in the group and Ntotal is the total
number of particles in the cell (all groups).
</P>
<P>The <I>mass</I> value computes the average mass of particles in each group:
</P>
<PRE>Mass = Sum_i (mass_i) / N 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_i is a sum over particles in the grid cell and in each group.
</P>
<P>The <I>massrho</I> value computes the mass density of particles in each
group:
</P>
<PRE>Massrho = Mass * fnum / volume 
</PRE>
<P>Mass is the value computed by the <I>mass</I> keyword, fnum is the
real/simulated particle ratio set by the <A HREF = "global.html">global fnum</A>
command, and volume is the flow volume of the grid cell.
</P>
<P>The <I>massfrac</I> value computes the mass fraction of particles in each
group:
</P>
<P>Massfrac = Sum_i (mass_i) / Masstotal
</P>
<P>where Sum_i is a sum over particles in the group and Masstotal is the
total mass of particles in the cell (all groups).
</P>
<P>The <I>u</I>, <I>v</I>, <I>w</I> values compute the components of the average
velocity of particles in each group:
</P>
<PRE>U = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i) / Sum_i (mass_i) 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>usq</I>, <I>vsq</I>, <I>wsq</I> values compute the squared component of
the average velocity of particles in each group.
</P>
<PRE>Usq = Sum_i (mass_i Vx_i Vx_i) / Sum_i (mass_i) 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>ke</I> value computes the average kinetic energy of particles in
each group:
</P>
<PRE>Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
KE = Sum_i (1/2 mass_i Vsq_i) / N 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>temp</I> value first computes the average kinetic energy of
particles in each group, as for the <I>ke</I> value.  This is then
converted to a temperature <I>T</I> by the following formula where <I>kB</I> is
the Boltzmann factor:
</P>
<PRE>Vsq = Vx*Vx + Vy*Vy + Vz*Vz
KE = Sum_i (1/2 mass_i Vsq_i) / N
T = KE / (3/2 kB) 
</PRE>
<P>Note that this definition of temperature does not subtract out a net
streaming velocity for particles in the grid cell, so it is not a
thermal temperature when the particles have a non-zero streaming
velocity.  See the <A HREF = "compute_sonine_grid.html">compute sonine/grid</A>
command to calculate thermal temperatures after subtracting out
streaming components of velocity.
</P>
<P>The <I>erot</I> value computes the average rotational energy of particles
in each group:
</P>
<PRE>Erot = Sum_i (erot_i) / N 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>trot</I> value computes a rotational temperature by the following
formula where <I>kB</I> is the Boltzmann factor:
</P>
<PRE>Trot = (2/kB) Sum_i (erot_i) / Sum_i (dof_i) 
</PRE>
<P>Dof_i is the number of rotational degrees of freedom for particle i.
</P>
<P>The <I>evib</I> value computes the average vibrational energy of particles
in each group:
</P>
<PRE>Evib = Sum_i (evib_i) / N 
</PRE>
<P>The <I>tvib</I> value computes a classical definition of vibrational
temperature, valid for continous distributions of vibrational energy,
by the following formula where <I>kB</I> is the Boltzmann factor:
</P>
<PRE>Tvib = (2/kB) Sum_i (evib_i) / Sum_i (dof_i) 
</PRE>
<P>Dof_i is the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for particle i.
</P>
<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-grid array, with the number of columns
equal to the number of values times the number of groups.  The
ordering of columns is first by values, then by groups.  I.e. if the
<I>n</I> and <I>u</I> values were specified as keywords, then the first two
columns would be <I>n</I> and <I>u</I> for the first group, the 3rd and 4th
columns would be <I>n</I> and <I>u</I> for the second group, etc.
</P>
<P>This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section 4.8</A> of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
Note that cells inside closed surfaces contain no particles.  Thus
they will compute a zero result for all their values.
</P>
<P>The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid values
from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section 4.4</A>
for an overview of SPARTA output options.
</P>
<P>The per-grid array values will be in the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
appropriate to the individual values as described above.  <I>N</I> is
unitless.  <I>Nrho</I> is in 1/distance^3 units for 3d simulations and
1/distance^2 units for 2d simulations.  <I>Mass</I> is in mass units.
