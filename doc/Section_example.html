<H3>5. Example problems 
</H3>
<P>The SPARTA distribution includes an examples sub-directory with
several sample problems.  Each problem is in a sub-directory of its
own.  They are all small problems that run quickly, requiring at most
a couple of minutes to run on a desktop machine.  Each problem has an
input script (in.*) and produces a log file (log.*) when it runs.
Some use data files of surface geometry as additional input.  Files
with species and collision and chemistry paramters are also included
(copied from the data dir) so the problems are self-contained.
</P>
<P>Sample log file outputs on different machines and different numbers of
processors are included in the directories to compare your answers to.
E.g. a log file like log.free.foo.P means it ran on P processors of
machine "foo".
</P>
<P>If the "dump image" lines in each script are uncommented, a series of
JPG snapshots will be produced.  Animations of several of the examples
can be viewed on the Movies section of the <A HREF = "http://sparta.sandia.gov">SPARTA WWW Site</A>.
</P>
<P>These are the sample problems in the examples sub-directories:
</P>
<P>TODO: put final list here
</P>
<P>free:      free molecular flow in a box
collide:   collisional flow in a box
</P>
<P>Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:
</P>
<PRE>cd free
cp ../../src/spa_g++ .           # copy SPARTA executable to this dir
spa_g++ < in.free                # run the problem 
</PRE>
<P>Running the simulation produces the files <I>image.*.jpg</I> and
<I>log.sparta</I>.  If you have the freely available ImageMagick toolkit on
your machine, you can run its "convert" command to create an animated
GIF, and visualize it from the FireFox browser as:
</P>
<P>convert image*jpg movie.gif
firefox ./movie.gif
</P>
<P>A similar command should work with other browsers.  Or you can select
"Open File" under the File menu of your browser and load the animated
GIF file directly.
</P>

<P>There is also a COUPLE directory with examples of how to use SPARTA as
a library, either by itself or in tandem with another code or library.
See the COUPLE/README file to get started.
