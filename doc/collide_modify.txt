collide_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

collide_modify keyword values ...  :pre

one or more keyword/value pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keywords = {vremax} or {remain} :l
  {vremax} values = Nevery startflag
    Nevery = zero vremax every this many timesteps
    startflag = {yes} or {no} = zero vremax at start of every run
  {remain} value = {yes} or {no} = hold remaining fraction of collisions over to next timestep
  {vibrate} value = {none} or {discrete} or {smooth}
:ule

[Examples:]

collide_modify vremax 1000 yes
collide_modify vremax 0 no remain no :pre

[Description:]

Set parameters that affect how collisions are performed.

The {vremax} keyword affects how often the Vremax parameter, for
collision frequency is re-zeroed during the simulation.  This
parameter is stored for each grid cell and each pair of collision
groups (groups are described by the "collide"_collide.html command).

The value of Vremax affects how many events are attempted in each grid
cell for a pair of groups, and thus the overall time spent performing
collisions.  Vremax is continuously set to the largest difference in
velocity between a pair of colliding particles.  The larger Vremax
grows, the more collisions are attempted for the grid cell on each
timestep, though this does not affect the number of collisions
actually performed.  Thus if Vremax grows large, collisions become
less efficient, though still accurate.

For non-equilibrium flows, it is typically desirable to reset Vremax
to zero fairly frequently (e.g. every 1000 steps) so that it does not
become large, due to anomolously fast moving particles.  In contrast,
when a system is at equilibrium, it is typically desirable to not
reset Vremax to zero since it will also stay roughly constant.

If {Nevery} is specified as 0, Vremax is not zeroed during a run.
Otherwise Vremax is zeroed on timesteps that are a multiple of
{Nevery}.  Additionally, if {startflag} is set to {yes}, Vremax is
zeroed at the start of every run.  If it is set to {no}, it is not.

The {remain} keyword affects how the number of attempted collisions
for each grid cell is calculated each timestep.  If the value is set
to {yes}, then any fractional collision count (for each grid cell and
pair of grgroups) is carried over to the next timestep.  E.g. if the
computed collision count is 7.3, then 7 attempts are made on this
timestep, and 0.3 are carried over to the next timestep, to be added
to the computed collision count for that step.  If the value is set to
{no}, then no carry-over is made.  Instead, in this example, 7
attempts are made and an 8th attempt is made conditionally with a
probability of 0.3, using a random number.

The {vibrate} keyword determines how vibrational energy is treated in
particle collisions and stored by particles.  If the value is set to
{none}, then vibrational energy is not tracked; every particle's
vibrational energy is 0.0.  If the value is set to {discrete}, each
particle's vibrational energy is set to discrete values, namely
multiples of kT where k = the Boltzmann constant and T is the
characteristic vibrational temperature set for the particle's species
in the file read by the "species"_species.html command.  If the value
is set to {smooth}, a particle's vibrational energy is a continuous
value.  Note that the {discrete} setting is only observed if the
vibrational degrees of freedom for the species is 2, as set in the
file read by the "species"_species.html command, i.e. for species that
are dimer molecules.  Species with more degrees of freedom (4,6,etc)
are always treated as if the setting were {smooth}.
