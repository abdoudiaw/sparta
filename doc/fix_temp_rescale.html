<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Reset the thermal temperature of all the particles within each grid
cell by explicitly rescaling their thermal velocities.  This is a
simple thermostatting operation to keep the thermal temperature of the
gas near the desired target temperature. This can be useful if an
external driving force is adding energy to the system.  Or if you wish
the thermal temperature of the system to heat or cool over time.
</P>
<P>The rescaling is applied to only the translational degrees of freedom
for the particles.  Their rotational or vibrational degrees of freedom
are not altered.
</P>
<P>Rescaling is performed every N timesteps. The target temperature is a
ramped value between the Tstart and Tstop temperatures at the
beginning and end of the run.
</P>
<P>This fix performs thermostatting on a per grid cell basis.  For each
grid cell, the center-of-mass velocity and thermal temperature of the
particles in the grid cell is computed.  The thermal temperature is
defined as the kinetic temperature after any center-of-mass motion
(e.g. a flow velocity) is subtracted from the collection of particles
in the grid cell.  These are the same calculations as are performed by
the <A HREF = "compute_thermal_grid.html">compute thermal/grid</A> command.  See its
doc page for the equations.
</P>
<P>From the current thermal temperature and the current target
temperature, a velocity scale factor is calculated.  That factor is
applied to each of the components of the thermal velocity for each
particle in the grid cell.
</P>
<P>After this rescaling, if the thermal temperature were re-computed for
the grid cell, it would be exactly the target temperature.

<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix produces no output.
</P>
<P>This fix can ramp its target temperature over multiple runs, using the
start and stop keywords of the run command. See the run command for
details of how to do this.
