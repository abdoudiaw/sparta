<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Create particles and add them to the simulation domain.  The
attributes of individual particles, such as species and velocity, are
determined by the mixture attributes, as specied by the <I>mix-ID</I>.  In
particular the <I>temp</I> and <I>vstream</I> attributes of the mixture affect
create particle velocities and internal energy modes.  See the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for more details.  Note that this
command can be used multiple times to add more and more particles.
</P>
<P>Particles are only created in grid cells which are entirely external
to surfaces.  Particles are not created in grid cells cut by surfaces.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When a particle is created at a specified temperature
(as set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command), it's rotational and
vibrational energy will also be initialized, consistent with the
temperature.  The <I>rotate</I> and <I>vibrate</I> options of the
<A HREF = "collide_modify.html">collide_modify</A> command determine how internal
energy modes are initialized.  If the <A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command
has not yet been specified, then no rotational or vibrational energy
will be assigned to created particles.  Thus if you wish created
particles to have non-zero internal energy, the <A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A>
and (optionally) <A HREF = "collide_modify.html">collide_modify</A> commands should
be used before this command.
</P>
<P>If the <I>n</I> style is used with <I>Np</I> = 0, then the number of created
particles is calculated by SPARTA as a function of the global <I>fnum</I>
value, the mixture number density, and the flow volume of the
simulation domain.
</P>
<P>The <I>fnum</I> value is set by the <A HREF = "global.html">global fnum</A> command.  The
mixture <I>nrho</I> is set by the <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  The flow
volume of the simulation is the total volume of the simulation domain
as specified by the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command, minus any
volume that is interior to surfaces defined by the
<A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command.  Note that the flow volume
includes volume contributions from grid cells cut by surfaces.
However particles are only created in grid cells entirely external to
surfaces.  This means that particles may be created in external cells
at a (slightly) higher density to compensate for no particles being
created in cut cells that still contribute to the overall flow volume.
</P>
<P>If the <I>n</I> style is used with a non-zero <I>Np</I>, then exactly <I>Np</I>
particles are created, which can be useful for debugging or
benchmarking purposes.
</P>
<P>Based on the value of <I>Np</I>, each grid cell will have a target number
of particles <I>M</I> to insert, which is a function of the cell's volume
as compared to the total system flow volume.  If <I>M</I> has a fractional
value, e.g. 12.5, then 12 particles will be inserted, and a 13th
depending on the outcome of a random number generation.  As grid cells
are looped over, the remainder fraction is accumulated, so that
exactly <I>Np</I> particles are created across all the processors.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The preceeding calcualation is actually done using
<I>weighted</I> cell volumes.  Cell volumes can be weighted using the
<A HREF = "global.html">global weight</A> command.
</P>
<P>Each particle is inserted at a random location within the grid cell.
The particle species is chosen randomly in accord with the <I>frac</I>
settings of the collection of species in the mixture, as set by the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.  The velocity of the particle is set
to the sum of the streaming velocity of the mixture and a thermal
velocity sampled from the thermal temperature of the mixture.  Both
the streaming velocity and thermal temperature are also set by the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command.
</P>
<P>The <I>single</I> style creates a single particle.  This can be useful for
debugging purposes, e.g. to advect a single particle towards a
surface.  A single particle of the specified species is inserted at
the specified position and with the specified velocity.  In this case
the <I>mix-ID</I> is ignored.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>global</I> keyword only applies when the <I>n</I> style is used, and
controls how particles are generated in parallel.
</P>
<P>If the value is <I>yes</I>, then every processor loops over all <I>Np</I>
particles.  As the coordinates of each is generated, each processor
checks what grid cell it is in, and only stores the particle if it
owns that grid cell.  Thus an identical set of particles are created,
no matter how many processors are running the simulation
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <I>global</I> yes option is not yet implemented.
</P>
<P>If the value is <I>no</I>, then each of the <I>P</I> processors generates a
<I>N/P</I> subset of particles, using its own random number generation.  It
only adds particles to grid cells that it owns, as described above.
This is a faster way to generate a large number of particles, but
means that the individual attributes of particles will depend on the
number of processors and the mapping of grid cells to procesors.  The
overall set of created particles should have the same statistical
properties as with the <I>yes</I> setting.
