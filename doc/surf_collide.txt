surf_collide command :h3

[Syntax:]

surf_collide ID style args keyword values ... :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the surface collision model :ulb,l
style = {specular} or {diffuse} or {vanish} :l
args = arguments for specific style :l
  {specular} args = none
  {diffuse} args = Tsurf acc
    Tsurf = temperature of surface (temperature units)
            Tsurf can be a variable (see below)
    acc = accommodation coefficient
  {vanish} args = none :pre
zero or more keyword/arg pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {translate} or {rotate} :l
values = values for specific keyword :l
  {translate} args = Vx Vy Vz
    Vx,Vy,Vz = translational velocity of surface (velocity units)
  {rotate} args = Pz Py Pz Wx Wy Wz
    Px,Py,Pz = point to rotate surface around (distance units)
    Wx,Wy,Wz = angular velocity of surface around point (radians/time) :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

surf_collide 1 specular
surf_collide 1 diffuse 273.15 0.9
surf_collide heatwall diffuse v_ramp 0.8
surf_collide heatwall diffuse v_ramp 0.8 translate 5.0 0.0 0.0 :pre

[Description:]

Define a model for particle-surface collisions.  One or more models
can be defined and assigned to different surfaces or simulation box
boundaries via the "surf_modify"_surf_modify.html or
"bound_modify"_bound_modify.html commands.  See "Section
4.9"_Section_howto.html#howto_9 for more details of how SPARTA defines
surfaces as collections of geometric elements, triangles in 3d and
line segments in 2d.

The ID for a surface collision model is used to identify it in other
commands.  Each surface collision model ID must be unique.  The ID can
only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.

The {specular} style computes a simple specular reflection model.  It
requires no arguments.  Specular reflection means that a particle
reflects off a surface element with its incident velocity vector
reversed with respect to the outward normal of the surface element.
The particle's speed is unchanged.

:line

The {diffuse} style computes a simple diffusive reflection model.

The model has 2 parameters set by the {Tsurf} and {acc} arguments.
{Tsurf} is the temperature of the surface.  {Acc} is an accommodation
coefficient.

Diffuse reflection emits the particle from the surface with no
dependence on its incident velocity.  A new velocity is assigned to
the particle, sampled from a Gaussian distribution consistent with the
surface temperature.  The new velocity will have thermal components in
the direction of the outward surface normal and the plane tangent to
the surface given by:

:c,image(Eqs/diffuse_normal.jpg)

The {Tsurf} value can be specified as an equal-style
"variable"_variable.html.  If the value is a variable, it should be
specified as v_name, where name is the variable name.  In this case,
the variable will be evaluated each timestep, and its value used to
determine the current surface temperature.

Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include "stats_style"_status_style.html command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.  Thus it is easy to specify a time-dependent temperature.

:line

The {vanish} style simply deletes any particle which hits the surface.

This is useful if a surface is defined to be an inflow boundary on the
simulation domain, e.g. using the "fix emit/surf"_fix_emit_surf.html
command.  Using this surface collision model will also treat the
surface as an outflow boundary.  This is similar to using the "fix
emit/face"_fix_emit_face.html command on a simulation box face while
also setting the face to be an outflow boundary via the "boundary
o"_boundary.html command.

Note that the "surf_react global"_surf_react.html command can also be
used to delete particles hitting a surface, by setting the {pdelete}
parameter to 1.0.  Using a surf_collide vanish command is simpler.

:line

The keyword {translate} can only be applied to the {diffuse} style.
It models the surface as if it were translating with a constant
velocity, specified by the vector (Vx,Vy,Vz).  This velocity is added
to the final post-collisional velocity of each particle that collides
with the surface.

The keyword {rotate} can only be applied to the {diffuse} style.  It
models the surface as if it were rotating with a constant angular
velocity, specified by the vector W = (Wx,Wy,Wz), around the specified
point P = (Px,Py,Pz).  Note that W and P define the rotation axis.
The magnitude of W defines the speed of rotation.  I.e. if the length
of W = 2*pi then the surface is rotating at one revolution per time
unit, where time units are defined by the "units"_units.html command.

When a particle collides with the surface at a point X = (x,y,z), the
collision point has a velocity given by V = (Vx,Vy,Vz) = W cross
(X-P).  This velocity is added to the final post-collisional velocity
of the particle.

The {rotate} keyword can be used to treat a simulation box boundary as
a rotating wall, e.g. the end cap of an axisymmetric cylinder.  Or to
model a rotating object consisting of surface elements, e.g. a sphere.
In either case, the wall or surface elements themselves do not change
position due to rotation.  They are simply modeled as having a
tangential velocity, as if the entire object were rotating.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For both the {translate} and {rotate} keywords the
added velocity can only be tangential to the surface, with no normal
component since the surface is not actually moving in the normal
direction.  SPARTA does not check that the specified translation or
rotation produces a tangential velocity.  However if does enforce the
condition by subtracting off any component of the added velocity that
is normal to the simulation box boundary or individual surface
element.

[Output info:]

All the surface collide models calculate a global vector of length 2.
The values can be used by the "stats_style"_stats_style.html command
and by "variables"_variable.html that define formulas.  The latter
means they can be used by any command that uses a variable as input,
e.g. "the "fix ave/time"_fix_ave_time.html command.  See "Section
4.4"_Section_howto.html#howto_4 for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The first element of the vector is the count of particles that hit
surface elements assigned to this collision model during the current
timestep.  The second element is the cummulative count of particles
that have hit surface elements since the current run began.

[Restrictions:]

The {translate} and {rotate} keywords cannot be used together.
