<H3>7. Additional tools 
</H3>
<P>SPARTA is designed to be a computational kernel for performing DSMC
computations.  Additional pre- and post-processing steps are often
necessary to setup and analyze a simulation.  A few additional tools
are provided with the SPARTA distribution in the tools directory and
are described briefly below.
</P>
<P>TODO: be specific about what Pizza.py tools can work with SPARTA data 
</P>
<P>Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
<A HREF = "http://pizza.sandia.gov">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for SPARTA simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download from <A HREF = "http://pizza.sandia.gov">the
Pizza.py WWW site</A>.
</P>




<P>TODO: any other tools

<H4><A NAME = "binary"></A>binary2txt tool 
</H4>
<P>TODO: need to create this tool?  different options for particle/grid/surf
</P>
<P>The file binary2txt.cpp converts one or more binary SPARTA dump files
into ASCII text files.  The syntax for running the tool is
</P>
<PRE>binary2txt file1 file2 ... 
</PRE>
<P>which creates file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.  This tool should be compiled
on a platform that can read the binary files created by a SPARTA run,
since binary files are not always compatible across all platforms.
