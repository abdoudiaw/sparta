fix temp/surf command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID temp/surf surf-ID Nevery source Tsurf emisurf:pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
temp/surf = style name of this fix command :l
surf-ID = group ID for which surface elements to consider :l
Nevery = adjust surface temperature once every Nevery steps :l
source = computeID or fixID :l
  computeID = c_ID or c_ID\[n\] for a compute that calculates per surf values
  fixID = f_ID or f_ID\[n\] for a fix that calculates per surf values :pre
Tsurf = initial temperature of surface (temperature units) :l
emisurf = emissivity of the surface (unitless, 0 < emisurf <= 1) :l,ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 temp/surf all 1000 c_1 800 0.9 :pre

[Description:]

Compute a surface element temperature once every Nevery steps.  This
command takes a compute or fix ID which should compute the flux of
total energy onto each surface elements, e.g. {etot} from the "compute
surf"_compute_surf.html command.

The specified {group-ID} must be the name of a surface element group,
as defined by the "group surf"_group.html command, which contains a
set of surf elements.

The specfied {Nevery} determines how often the surface temperatures
are re-computed.

The {source} can be specified as a per surface element quantity
calculated by a compute, such as the "compute surf"_compute_surf.html
command.  It can also be specified a per surface element quantity
calculated by a fix that perform time-averaging, such as "fix
ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html.  That fix can time average per-surf
quantities from per-surf computes.

The temperature of the surface element is calculated from the
Stefan-Boltzmann law for a gray-body, which states that 

q_wall = sigma * emisurf * Tsurf^4 :pre

where q_wall is the heat flux to the surface, sigma is the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant, {emisurf} is the surface emissivity, and
{Tsurf} is the resulting surface temperature.

The specified emissivity {emisurf} is a unitless coefficient from 0.0
to 1.0, which determines the emissivity of the surface.  An emissivity
coefficient of 1.0 means the surface is a black-body that radiates all
the energy it receives.

The specified {Tsurf} is the initial temperature of each surface
element.  The value for each surface is reset every {Nevery} timesteps
by the formula above.

NOTE: is this formula cumulative over time, or flux for some
time interval ?

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

[Restrictions:]

Currently this fix can only be used in simulations that define
explicit non-distributed surfaces.  Distributed and implicit surface
support will be added at a later time.
