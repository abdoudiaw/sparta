This directory contains various kinds of input data files for SPARTA.
You can add your own files to this directory, using the existing files
as templates to get the format correct.  Or you can copy these or
similar data files into the directory you run SPARTA from.

Files that end in "species" contain thermophysical properties of
chemical species and are read by the species command.

Files that end in "vss" or "vhs" or "hs" contain collision model
parameters that can be for the variable soft sphere (VSS) or variable
hard sphere (vhs) or hard-sphere (HS) models.  These are read by the
collide command.

Files that end with "tce" list reactions for the Total Collision
Energy (TCE) model and are read by the react command.

Files that start with "sdata" contain lists of surface elements and
are read by the read_surf command.

Files that end with "stl" are STL-formatted surface files which can be
converted to SPARTA formatted surface files via the stl2surf.py tool
in the tools directory.

See the doc pages for the following commands which
describe the format of the corresponding files:

species = doc/species.html
vss/vhs/hs = doc/collide.html
tce = doc/react.html
sdata = doc/read_surf.html
